# Json-parser in Rust ðŸ¦€

A simple json/jsonc parser in rust,

The parsing is done in 2 pass, In first pass Lexing is done to get the Vector of Tokens and in second the actual parsing. For parsing i just implemented a simple recursive descent parser.

The grammar i used can be found [here](./json-grammar.md)

TODO: Implement de-serialization

## Showcase

Blazingly fast ðŸš€

Tested on a 700k line JSON [file](./test-json/huge.json)

## Things i should have done differently

1. [DONE] Better error handling, in tokens i should have captured there position in the file, so at the time of errors during
   tokenisation i could have reported them.
2. At the time of tokenization using an iterator became a pain in the ass, just a vector of chars would have made life
   easier i think but idk.
3. [DONE Partially] Better error handling at the time of parsing.
