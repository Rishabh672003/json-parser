The UN OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data worked with a wide range\nof technical partners to develop a methodology that was then endorsed by the Somalia ICCG\nand HCT.\nDaily FloodScan (1998-2022) & WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) raster data was analysed to gain\nunderstanding of ood conditions across Somalia for both March-April-May (MAM) and\nOctober-November-December (OND) seasons. FloodScan daily ood fraction Standard Flood\nExposure Depiction (SFED) was aggregated to yearly seasonal maximum fraction composites\nfor both the MAM and OND seasons for all years of historical FloodScan data (1998-2022).\nThe yearly seasonal SFED composites were then processed/reclassied in two distinct ways:\n1. Composites reclassied to binary using a 20 percent ood fraction threshold.\n2. Composites masked to just remove any ood fraction values < 0.05 percent and the\nood fraction (0-100 percent) retained.\nAll composites in both sets of processed yearly-seasonal ood fraction rasters were then\nmultiplied by the WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) population estimate raster to create two sets of\nyearly seasonal ood exposure rasters. These were then aggregated at the second\nadministrative level via zonal statistics (sum) to obtain the estimated population exposure per\ndistrict for each season across all years for each set. These estimates were converted to the\npercent of population exposed by dividing the estimates by the total population per district\n(from World Pop raster). The percent exposure gure was then applied to the updated 2024\npopulation data set (UN OCHA, UNFPA Methodology) to obtain updated population exposure\nestimates. These data were further aggregated to administrative level 1.\nRanges for exposure were estimated using percentiles for both the MAM and OND seasons per\nadministrative level. As ECMWF seasonal forecast predicts an above average precipitation\nseason for MAM 2024, the range of population exposed was based on the 50th-95th percentile\nlevels. Since there was no available data to inform predictions for OND 2024, the 25-75th\npercentile values were used to bound the range. The lower and upper limits of the ranges were\nPage 1 of 2\ncalculated at the administrative level using all of the historical yearly seasonal ood exposure\nestimates. The two sets of range estimates were combined conservatively by taking the\nmaximum value for both the upper and lower bounds for each season.\nContact the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data via Leonardo Milano, Team Lead for Data\nScience at leonardo.milano@un.org with any questions or feedback.\nPage 2 of 2"

These events can exploit or exacerbate existing\nvulnerabilities.1\n In some cases, they may also create new vulnerabilities that can increase the risk of future\ndata incidents.\nHumanitarians have not had a common understanding of what comprises a data incident, nor is there\na minimum technical standard for how these incidents should be prevented and managed. How the\nhumanitarian sector develops tools and implements procedures for data incident management will play\na significant role in the evolution of the ethical, human rights, technical, and professional standards of\nhumanitarian operations.\n1 “A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by\n a threat source.” NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\nGUIDANCE NOTE SERIES\nDATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION\nDATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n• Humanitarian data incidents are events involving the management of data that have caused\nharm or have the potential to cause harm to crisis-affected people, organizations and their\noperations, and other individuals or groups.\n• Examples of humanitarian data incidents include physical breaches of infrastructure,\nunauthorised disclosure of data, and the use of beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes,\namong others.\n• A data incident has four aspects: (i) a threat source, (ii) a threat event, (iii) a vulnerability and (iv)\nan adverse impact.\n• There are five steps to responding to data incidents: (i) notification, (ii) classification, (iii)\ntreatment, and (iv) closure of the incident, as well as (v) learning.\n“If aid actors digitize more of their data and communications, they urgently\n need to increase their digital security efforts. Though some actors are\n developing promising protective tools, aid organizations overall might be\n well advised to listen to a quote from IT-security circles: ‘There are two\n types of organizations: those who have been hacked, and those who will be.”\n- Rahel Dette, Do No Digital Harm: Mitigating Technology Risk in Humanitarian Contexts\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 2\nDEFINITIONS AND FRAMEWORKS FOR UNDERSTANDING DATA INCIDENTS\nGovernments and the private sector have developed definitions and frameworks for understanding data\nincidents that serve as helpful references for the humanitarian sector.\n• The International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) in ISO Standard 27000 defines a ‘critical\nincident’ as “a single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information security events that have a\nsignificant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security.”2\n• The United States Department of Commerce National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)\ndefines an adverse event involving a ‘cyber threat’ as “[a]n event or condition that has the potential\nfor causing asset loss and the undesirable consequences or impact from such loss.”3\n• Mahmood Sher-Jan of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) identifies three\nadditional categories of events that expand upon the NIST definition of adverse events. These are, in\norder of escalating severity: security incidents; privacy incidents; and data breaches.4\n2 International Organization for Standardization, ISO/IEC 27000:2018.\n3 NIST Computer Security Resource Center Glossary.\n4 IAPP, Is It an Incident or a Breach, How to Tell and Why It Matters, Mahmoud Sher-Jan (February 2017).\n5 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nHumanitarian data incidents may include physical breaches of infrastructure, unauthorised disclosure of\ndata, and the use of ‘anonymised’ beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes, among others. Data\nincidents can also occur without technical infrastructure being compromised in any way. The legitimate\ncollection, use, and sharing of data by humanitarians can still have operational implications that may\nconstitute a data incident in cases where rumors, cultural sensitivities, political dynamics, and other\nfactors lead to adverse effects linked to the data.\nExamples of possible humanitarian data incidents\nA data incident has four factors: a threat source, a threat event, a vulnerability and an adverse impact.5\nBelow are two types of hypothetical data incidents that could occur in humanitarian contexts.\nThe first scenario is a typical data breach incident situated in the context of an armed conflict. The\nsecond is an example of the type of vulnerabilities that can initiate data incidents unique to the\nhumanitarian sector.\n1. Unauthorized access to data occurs [impact] due to armed actors [source] raiding a facility and\nseizing hard-drives containing beneficiary data [event]. The hard-drives were unencrypted\n[vulnerability].\n2. Absence of guidance limiting data collection for a specific purpose [vulnerability] leads to staff\ncollecting data about the marital status of pregnant women [source]. A data breach [event] later\noccurs, resulting in an increased chance of physical violence [impact] against unwed pregnant\nbeneficiaries.\nThese scenarios demonstrate how to think about identifying causal chains that may create contextspecific data incidents. \nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 3\n6 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nRISK MODELS\nThe figure below presents a generic risk model with risk factors that organizations can use to understand\nhow a data incident may occur. A threat event exploits an existing vulnerability that is either magnified by\npredisposing conditions or mitigated by security controls already in place. This causes adverse impacts that\nproduce organizational risk, which can include risks for the organization and for affected people.\nFigure 1. “Generic Risk Model with Key Risk Factors”. Source: NIST Special Publication\n800-30 pg. 126\nThe figure below presents one example of how this generic risk model could be adapted to the\nhumanitarian sector.\nFigure 2. Risk Model with Key Risk Factors adapted to a humanitarian context.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 4\nHumanitarian organizations can develop their own specific risk models for data incident management\nincorporating these factors. The nature of these risk factors and how they come together to constitute a\ndata incident will vary from one organization to another and should be adapted to specific operational\nrealities.\nSTEPS IN DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nAfter clearly defining what constitutes a data incident, organizations can develop Standard Operating\nProcedures (SOPs) for data incident management.\nData incident management SOPs should include the following 5 steps: 1) notification, 2) classification;\n3) treatment; 4) closure; and 5) knowledge base.7\n7 The Centre for Humanitarian Data provides several sources of guidance that can inform the development of Data Incident Management SOPs on\n the Data Responsibility page.\n8 How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16, Antonio Jose Segovia, (October 2015.).\n9 For humanitarian organizations, an example of such a classification is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of\n Patient Safety, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\n10 WHO, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\nFigure 3: Five steps in the treatment of security incidents (Source: How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16,\nAntonio Jose Segovia8\nThe application of these steps in an organization can look as follows:\n1. Notification of the incident: A person detects an incident and notifies relevant colleagues according\nto the communication procedures of the organization (usually an email, a phone call, a software tool,\netc.). A notification should contain, if possible, a description of the key risk factors involved in the\nincident: source, event, vulnerability and impact.\n2. Classification of the incident: The recipient of the notification classifies the incident based on it’s\nimpact (high, medium or low) and the urgency of treatment (high, medium or low).9\n Managing risk\nbegins with classifying all incidents, whether or not tangible harm actually results from them.10\n3. Treatment of the incident: A technical expert decides on the necessary measures to treat the incident\nonce the incident has been classified and the time for treatment has been agreed.\n4. Closure of the incident: All information generated during the treatment is recorded and the person\nwho first sent notification of the incident is informed that the incident is closed.\n5. Knowledge base: All information generated during the treatment of the incident is used to inform and\ntrain colleagues and as reference material for future similar incidents.\nHumanitarian organizations can base their SOPs on this 5-step model, describing how each step should\ntake place within their organization. This should include the functions/roles and teams within an\norganization that are responsible at each stage of the process. These steps should be incorporated into\nor extended from existing incident response protocols (e.g. security incident management related to\nhumanitarian access).\nIn a given response context, organizations should also work to integrate any joint incident management\nprocedures into existing coordination structures, such as the clusters and mechanisms for inter- and\nintra-cluster coordination.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 5\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT IN\nHUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS\nIntroducing or improving data incident management in humanitarian operations is critical to more\nresponsible data practice in the sector. The Centre for Humanitarian Data recommends that organizations\nfocus on the following areas:\n1. Establish a common understanding of data incident management\nUse a risk model to understand the causal chain that can lead to data incidents for specific offices and\nsystems. Identify key threat actors and vulnerabilities for offices and systems and understand existing\nsecurity controls and their effectiveness. Finally, map existing data incident management capacity\nand determine whether it is positioned appropriately. Once clear definitions and processes are\narticulated, invest in staff awareness and support a culture of open dialogue about incidents, in which\nproactive reporting and management of incidents is incentivized, not punished.\n2. Strengthen data incident management capacity\nTake measures to put in place security controls to mitigate the risk of data incidents, and share best\npractice with partners. Build on existing work in the sector to fill governance gaps which can create\nvulnerabilities for your organization. Engage with organizational partners to set up information\nchannels around data incidents. Share known vulnerabilities in a controlled manner with trusted\ncounterparts for cross-organizational learning.\n3. Support continuous learning\nSupport learning and development of improved data incident management practices by organizing\ntraining and drills based on scenarios likely to occur in different operational settings. These exercises\nshould occur regularly and may even involve multiple organizations training and drilling together. In\naddition, document actual data incidents as cases for internal knowledge development.\nOrganizations are encouraged to share their experience in the development of data incident management\nwith the Centre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.\nThis project is co-funded\nby the European Union\nThis document covers humanitarian aid activities implemented with the financial assistance of the\nEuropean Union.

The UN OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data worked with a wide range\nof technical partners to develop a methodology that was then endorsed by the Somalia ICCG\nand HCT.\nDaily FloodScan (1998-2022) & WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) raster data was analysed to gain\nunderstanding of ood conditions across Somalia for both March-April-May (MAM) and\nOctober-November-December (OND) seasons. FloodScan daily ood fraction Standard Flood\nExposure Depiction (SFED) was aggregated to yearly seasonal maximum fraction composites\nfor both the MAM and OND seasons for all years of historical FloodScan data (1998-2022).\nThe yearly seasonal SFED composites were then processed/reclassied in two distinct ways:\n1. Composites reclassied to binary using a 20 percent ood fraction threshold.\n2. Composites masked to just remove any ood fraction values < 0.05 percent and the\nood fraction (0-100 percent) retained.\nAll composites in both sets of processed yearly-seasonal ood fraction rasters were then\nmultiplied by the WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) population estimate raster to create two sets of\nyearly seasonal ood exposure rasters. These were then aggregated at the second\nadministrative level via zonal statistics (sum) to obtain the estimated population exposure per\ndistrict for each season across all years for each set. These estimates were converted to the\npercent of population exposed by dividing the estimates by the total population per district\n(from World Pop raster). The percent exposure gure was then applied to the updated 2024\npopulation data set (UN OCHA, UNFPA Methodology) to obtain updated population exposure\nestimates. These data were further aggregated to administrative level 1.\nRanges for exposure were estimated using percentiles for both the MAM and OND seasons per\nadministrative level. As ECMWF seasonal forecast predicts an above average precipitation\nseason for MAM 2024, the range of population exposed was based on the 50th-95th percentile\nlevels. Since there was no available data to inform predictions for OND 2024, the 25-75th\npercentile values were used to bound the range. The lower and upper limits of the ranges were\nPage 1 of 2\ncalculated at the administrative level using all of the historical yearly seasonal ood exposure\nestimates. The two sets of range estimates were combined conservatively by taking the\nmaximum value for both the upper and lower bounds for each season.\nContact the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data via Leonardo Milano, Team Lead for Data\nScience at leonardo.milano@un.org with any questions or feedback.\nPage 2 of 2"

Despite the overall reduction, reported global cases rose throughout June driven by increases in the\nEastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and the Americas. The Omicron variant continues to comprise\nthe majority (94 percent) of sequenced cases, including the Omicron sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5 which appear\nmore capable of evading immunity from vaccination or past infection. Countries in the Global Humanitarian\nOverview (GHO) comprised 8 and 14 percent of global cases and deaths respectively in Q2 2022, reporting 4.6\nmillion cases and 23,000 deaths.\n• WHO data reveals between 597,000 to 2.2 million excess deaths attributable to COVID-19 occurred in countries\nwith humanitarian response plans (HRP) between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021, significantly more\ndeaths from COVID-19 than officially reported. This data highlights the steep toll of the pandemic across\nhumanitarian settings.\n• Total vaccine doses delivered to HRP countries fell by half in Q2 2022 compared to Q1 2022. Eight HRP\ncountries received no doses this quarter, including Burundi, CAR, El Salvador, Libya, Niger, Ukraine, Venezuela,\nand Yemen. Of these, Burundi, Niger, and Yemen are yet to vaccinate more than 5 percent of populations.\nCOVAX was the largest supplier of doses to HRP countries in May and June.\n• Projected economic growth declined further in 17 HRP countries from January to June 2022 due to the\ncompounding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the secondary impacts of the war in Ukraine. Expected\nGDP growth in 2023 has been reduced by a percentage point or more for 8 HRP countries, with Mozambique\n(-3.6), Sudan (-3), and Niger (-2.3) facing the steepest reductions in expected growth. Humanitarian settings\nalso face significant debt risks, with four HRP countries – Chad, Mozambique, Somalia, and Sudan – currently\nin debt distress.\n• Fourteen immunization campaigns continue to be postponed due to COVID-19 in Q2 2022, impacting more than\n52 million people across 13 GHO countries. The postponement of these campaigns, targeting diseases like\nyellow fever, measles, cholera, and polio, increase the risk of secondary diseases spreading across\nhumanitarian settings, with outbreaks of diseases like measles occurring in Q2 2022.\n• New data from UN Women reveals that 26 HRP countries had gender sensitive pandemic policies, with seven\ngender sensitive policies implemented on average. Colombia implemented the most (31), followed by 1\nHonduras (17) and oPt (16). Iraq and Libya had none.

Epidemiological Update\nGlobal reported COVID-19 cases in the Second Quarter 2022 (Q2 2022) declined by 71 percent, falling from 196 million\nto 57 million. This decline, however, likely reflects reduced testing and monitoring meaning fewer cases are detected.\nEven with testing scaled back, and despite the overall drop during Q2, reported COVID-19 cases rose in June globally for three\nconsecutive weeks. Regional increases in the Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and the Americas drove this\nincrease. This spike in reported COVID-19 may signal a larger increase in COVID-19 transmission cases beyond that reflected 2\nin reported figures, given lower rates of testing. The weekly rate of deaths remained stable globally, although increases in\ndeaths typically lag cases and thus could rise in coming weeks.\nThe Omicron variant comprises most COVID-19 cases (94 percent), with Omicron sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5\nincreasingly represented within sequenced samples. These two sub-variants appear more capable of evading immunity\nfrom vaccination or past infection. BA.4 and BA.5 were classified as Variants of Concern by the European Centre for Disease\nProtection in May 2022, and they are currently driving surges in COVID-19 cases in countries like the USA. 3\nCountries in the Global Humanitarian Overview (GHO) comprised 8 percent and 14 percent of global cases and deaths\nrespectively in Q2 2022, reporting 4.6 million deaths and 23,000 deaths. Of these 282,000 cases and 2,670 deaths\noccurred in countries with Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs). Across HRPs, Burundi (11 percent) and Guatemala (9\npercent) reported the largest increases in cases this quarter, while Guatemala (7 percent) and DRC (3 percent) reported the\nlargest increase in deaths. Humanitarian settings continue to face significant barriers to testing and surveillance, meaning\nmany COVID-19 cases and deaths may go unreported.\nFigure 1 & 2.

This is significantly more\nthan reported in official figures. Low rates of testing and surveillance masked initial reporting, but new data from WHO and\nother sources identify additional excess deaths likely attributable to COVID-19 occurring between 1 January 2020 and 31\nDecember 2021.4\nFurthermore, newly released data collected across 25 low- and middle-income countries finds that the risk of dying from\nCOVID-19 was twice as high in lower-income countries compared to high-income ones. This is likely due to low-income 5\ncountries having less access to vaccinations, weaker health care systems, more multigenerational households, and less ability\nto work from home.

Low vaccination leaves humanitarian settings vulnerable to\nfuture surges and new variants. Even in settings where doses have been delivered, there remain barriers to administration\nincluding weak healthcare systems, vaccine hesitancy, compounding crises, and transport issues. Yemen, Somalia, Syria,\nChad, South Sudan, DRC, and Burundi are yet to administer more than one-third of delivered doses.\nSince the end of Q1, the overall vaccination rate across the AMC92 – the 92 lower-income countries eligible for\nfinancing support through COVAX to access vaccines – has increased from 40 percent to 47 percent, whereas the\naverage vaccination rate in the 34 countries for concerted support has increased from 7 to 10 percent. The COVID-19\nVaccine Delivery Partnership has been supporting the AMC92 countries since January 2022 in accelerating vaccine delivery\nwith a focus on the 34 countries at or below 10 percent vaccination coverage in January 2022. At the end of Q1, 19 countries\nwere at or below 10 percent coverage which has dropped slightly to 18 countries by the end of Q2. Of those 18 countries, 14\nface ongoing humanitarian emergencies, highlighting the challenges and complexities associated with vaccine delivery in a\ncontext of fragile health systems, competing health and humanitarian priorities, and significant logistical challenges. These\ncountries continue to exhibit low or flatlining vaccination rates, highlighting the need for more tailored approaches, including\ncloser engagement with humanitarian partners on the ground to support vaccine delivery.\nFigure 8. Population coverage by delivery and admin by HRP country\n(as of 30 June 2022)\nMore than 868 million in combined vaccine financing was approved by the World Bank (850 million) and GAVI’s Country\nDelivery Support (18.5 million) in Q2 2022, reaching eight GHO countries. This is a significant increase from total vaccine\nfinancing approved in Q1 2022, during which 257.8 million was approved for eight GHO countries. Türkiye received the most\n(500 million) followed by Ethiopia (195 million) and Costa Rica (120 million).

Secondary Impacts\nEconomic Effects\nProjected economic growth declined further in 17 HRP countries from January to June 2022, with the compounding\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the secondary impacts of the war in Ukraine globally setting back GDP growth,\nrecovery of incomes to pre-pandemic levels, and poverty reduction. The pandemic lef the world more vulnerable to the 6\nsecondary economic shocks now stemming from the war in Ukraine, including rising food and fuel prices and inflation. As of\nJune 2022, global growth is expected to fall from 5.7 percent in 2021 to 2.9 percent in 2022, a growth rate 1.2 percent lower\nthan that predicted in January 2022. Global growth will likely be dampened through 2024 due to the lingering effects of the\npandemic and disruptions from the war. The World Bank predicts several years of above-average inflation and below-average\ngrowth. In 40 percent of developing economies, real income per capita will remain below pre-COVID-19 levels in 2023. Of the\n21 HRPs for which data is available, 17 face lower projected real GDP growth for 2022 and/or 2023 compared to growth\npredictions made in January 2022.

Compounding crises – including\nclimate change, ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict and unrest, rising food and fuel prices, and food insecurity\nall contribute to lower economic growth in these settings. Future COVID-19 surges or new variants could further undermine\neconomic growth by increasing uncertainty and causing shipping delays. HRP countries are particularly vulnerable due to low\nrates of vaccination, limited access to therapeutics, and weakened healthcare systems. Projected 2022 GDP growth increased\nin six HRP countries, however, including Iraq and Nigeria, in part because they are oil exporting economies and thus benefit\nfrom rising commodity prices in recent months.\nHumanitarian settings also face significant debt risks, with four HRP countries – Chad, Mozambique, Somalia, and\nSudan – currently in debt distress. An additional seven are at high risk of debt distress. Debt servicing payments were\npaused during the COVID-19 pandemic, resuming in 2022 right as interest rates began to increase. This makes debt more\nexpensive and less sustainable for humanitarian settings. Wealthy countries pledged in 2021 to reallocate USD 100 billion in\nSpecial Drawing Rights to lower-income countries. At present, there are pledges to reallocate USD 60 billion. 7\nRoutine Immunization & Health\nFourteen immunization campaigns continue to be postponed due to COVID-19 in Q2 2022, impacting more than 52\nmillion people across 13 GHO countries. The postponement of these campaigns, targeting diseases like yellow fever,\nmeasles, cholera, and polio, increase the risk of secondary diseases spreading across humanitarian settings.\nMeasles cases, for instance, spiked by 79 percent in the first two months of 2022 compared to 2021. This is due to routine\nimmunization disruption caused by the pandemic. HRP countries, according to April 2022 data, are most impacted, with 8\n Devex, ‘Opinion: Ukraine conflict shows urgency of SDR reallocation for Africa,’ 24 May 2022.

Pakistan is currently experiencing a 9\nsurge in wild polio cases. Disruptions to routine immunization caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are another compounding 10\nfactor contributing to polio’s spread in Pakistan. In April 2020, more than 40 million children across Pakistan missed their\npolio vaccination afer the cancellation of an immunization campaign, with subsequent disruptions persisting throughout the\npandemic. National healthcare systems must continue to be strengthened, both to manage COVID-19 long-term and to 11\nabsorb increased cases of secondary diseases due to pandemic related disruptions of routine immunization.\nGender Update\nNew data from UN women reveals that 26 HRP countries had gender sensitive pandemic policies, with seven gender\nsensitive policies implemented on average. The refers to policies adopted at the national level that directly address 12\nchallenges which uniquely or disproportionately affect women and girls, including violence against women and girls (96\npolicies), women’s economic security (94 policies), or unpaid care work (3 policies). For instance, a policy addressing women’s\neconomic security may target women to receive household cash transfers or prioritize for benefits a subset of workers in\nwhich women are significantly overrepresented. Colombia implemented the most gender sensitive policies (31), followed by\nHonduras (17) and oPt (16). Iraq and Libya had none. Only three countries – Burundi, oPt, and Ukraine – implemented policies\ndirectly supporting unpaid care. Women took on a greater burden of unpaid caregiving, including caring for sick relatives\nduring the pandemic. Failing to support this labor disadvantages women and undermines their empowerment.\nFigure 11.

The pandemic eroded progress on gender-based violence,\neconomic empowerment, education, and healthcare. COVID-19 and its secondary effects lef women and girls in a worse\nposition than before the pandemic and increased vulnerability to compounding crises, such as food insecurity or conflict. The\npandemic set back progress on domestic violence, with the percent of respondents who believe there are acceptable\ncircumstances to hit a partner increasing by 2 percentage points to 19 percent, according to a 20-country survey. Women’s 13\neconomic security also remains at risk. Globally, women’s poverty continues to increase, with more women in poverty than\nmen. Over 11 million girls remain at risk of not returning to school, reducing their employment and earning opportunities 14\nand increasing the risk of early marriage and pregnancy. Many women and girls also lost access to reproductive care as 15\nhealthcare systems were strained by COVID-19, contributing to maternal mortality, unwanted pregnancies, disease, and\nschool dropouts. Global estimates suggest that the pandemic caused a 37 percent increase in maternal deaths. Across Latin 16\nAmerica and the Caribbean, 1 in 4 girls did not have access to family planning services. As data remains limited, the full 17\nrepercussions of the pandemic on women and girls may not be known for years to come.\n4. Funding Update\nAt the end of Q2 2022, 22 percent of total humanitarian financing needs (46.35 billion total GHO) are met. Thirteen HRP\ncountries have received more than 20 percent of funding, Libya (45.7 percent), Central African Republic (38.7 percent), and\nAfghanistan (34.4 percent). The Ukraine flash appeal, which supersedes the HRP, has received 78.2 percent of required\nfunding. Top doners in 2022 to date include the USA (48.5 percent), the European Commission (6.8 percent), and Germany (5\npercent).\n ‘The Levers of Change Gender Equality Attitudes Study 2022. 20 June 2022.’ Available at: https://www.unstereotypealliance.org/en/resources/research- 13\nand-tools/the-levers-of-change-gender-equality-attitudes-study-2022\n UN Women, ‘Poverty depends for women and girls, according to latest projections.’ 1 February 2022.

Background\nThis document summarizes the documentation and ndings of the peer review of the model\nused by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund to trigger the drought anticipatory action\nframework in Chad. The model is a go-no-go trigger mechanism designed to anticipate\nhumanitarian impacts of seasonal drought in a sub-region of Chad.\nThe review has been conducted between January and May 2023.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nYou can nd all the documentation regarding the model, its application and the review process\nat the following links:\n● The Model Card describes the version of the model that was endorsed by humanitarian\naction in November 2022 and was completed in January 2023.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix was completed in February 2023 by Carlos Osorio-Ramírez,\nAssociate Professor at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.\n● The Implementation Plan was completed in February 2023. It summarizes how the\ntrigger model is used to trigger anticipatory action and the agreed activation protocol.\n● The Ethical Matrix aims to identify all stakeholders and potential issues regarding the\nintended use of the model. The Ethical Matrix was completed in May 2023 by Anna Lena\nHuhn, Southern Africa Regional Anticipatory Action Advisor at the United Nations World\nFood Programme.\nA summary of the main ndings and recommendations is provided below.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\nOverall, the use cases are well-described and adequately explained. The documentation of the\nlimitations of the model could be extended in its description, as is the case of the biomass\nanomaly and its connection with scenarios like extreme dryness or late onset.\nModel Development and Documentation\nIt is advisable to provide further documentation on the different data sources used by the team\nto validate the selection of indicators and estimate the performance of the model. Also, some\ndata is not available in a machine readable format and it would be good to explain how the team\ndealt with this issue.\nModel Evaluation\nIt is unclear what is an acceptable level of accuracy for the model. The team should better\narticulate how the performance benchmark was established and how the performance metrics\nwere evaluated and presented to the nal stakeholders.\nOperational Readiness\nIt would be good to expand the analysis of the missed activations of the models and the\npotential false alarms that the model could be providing.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nFalse Negatives\nA false negative occurs when no drought impact is predicted but drought conditions occur.\nThe team could consider additional mitigation strategies such as the use of citizen science or\nground observations to complement the forecast-based trigger.\nInsucient Data\nInsucient data refers to the gaps in impact data used to verify the forecast predictions.\nInsucient data might limit the precise prediction of forecasted humanitarian impact and\nexpose local populations to adverse humanitarian impact induced by a drought event, requiring\na large-scale humanitarian response ex-post. The team should consider the feasibility of adding\nfurther vulnerability layers in future iterations of the model.\nFalse Positives\nA false positive happens when drought impact is predicted but no drought conditions occur.\nAnticipatory action follows the ‘no regret’ principle, but a false alarm can still lead to inadequate\nresource allocation with a high potential impact on affected communities. The anticipatory\naction framework could indicate a precise mitigation strategy in a clearer manner.\nLack of Trust and Ownership\nLack of trust and ownership refers to the limited involvement of local and regional authorities in\nthe model design and validation. This may lead to little ownership and trust put into the model\nand eventually to political blockages in activations. In future framework versions a clear strategy\nfor the involvement of affected populations and an approach to accountability to affected\npopulations should be identied.\nLack of Transparency\nLack of transparency refers to the algorithms not being made available or not being transparent.\nThe anticipatory action framework should reect clearer strategies to engage with local leaders\nto better understand what is happening on the ground and obtain early buy-in. Mitigation\nstrategy for a potential lack of transparency should be expanded in the model card and/or the\nanticipatory action framework.\nInaction\nInaction refers to the situation in which drought impact is predicted but no action is taken.\nInaction in case of trigger activation is unlikely, given the pre-allocated nancing attached to it\nand the UN-validated anticipatory action framework. Inaction might nevertheless be a\npossibility, if government or local authorities block the roll-out of interventions on the ground or\nin case of conict upsurge. The team could consider adding a consensus-based\ndecision-making option around activation or non-activation in the event of specic events or\nsituational context not considered in the model design (e.g., higher levels of vulnerability or\nincrease in armed conict, etc.)\nFeedback\nThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic,\nresearch and private sector to engage with us on the peer review process.

This guidance note deals with sensitive personal and non-personal data.\n2 Roepstorff, K., Faltas, C. and Hövelmann, S., 2020. Counterterrorism Measures and Sanction Regimes: Shrinking Space for Humanitarian Aid\n Organisations.\n\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\nGUIDANCE NOTE SERIES\nDATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION\nRESPONSIBLE DATA SHARING WITH DONORS\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n• Sharing sensitive personal and non-personal data without adequate safeguards can exacerbate\nrisks for crisis-affected people, humanitarian organizations and donors.\n• Donors regularly request data from the organizations they fund in order to fulfil their obligations\nand objectives. Some of these requests relate to sensitive information and data which needs to\nbe protected in order to mitigate risk.\n• Common objectives for data sharing with donors include: (i) situational awareness and\nprogramme design; (ii) accountability and transparency; and (iii) legal, regulatory, and policy\nrequirements.\n• Common constraints related to sharing data with donors include: (i) lack of regulatory framework\nfor responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data; (ii) capacity gaps; and (iii) purpose\nlimitation.\n• Donors and humanitarian organizations can take the following steps to minimize risks while\nmaximizing benefits when sharing sensitive data: (i) reviewing and clarifying the formal or\ninformal frameworks that govern the collection and sharing of disaggregated data; (ii) formalizing\nand standardising requests for sensitive data; (iii) investing in data management capacities of\nstaff and organisations; and (iv) adopting common principles for donor data management.\nINTRODUCTION\nDonors have an important role in the humanitarian data ecosystem, both as drivers of increased data\ncollection and analysis, and as direct users of data. This is not a new phenomenon; the need for\naccountability and transparency in the use of donor funding is broadly understood and respected. However,\nin recent years, donors have begun requesting data that can be sensitive. This includes personal data about\nbeneficiaries and various forms of disaggregated data, such as household-level survey results and data\nabout the delivery of assistance disaggregated by demographic and/or group dimensions (e.g. ethnicity,\nprotection group, etc.).1\nConcerns around requests for such data have led donors and humanitarian organizations to place more\nemphasis on identifying strategies for data responsibility: the safe, ethical and effective management\nof data. Data responsibility requires donors and humanitarian organizations to take actions that help\nminimize risks while maximizing benefits of data. This is particularly challenging in cases where donors\nrequest sensitive data.

Responsible data-sharing with donors: accountability, transparency and data protection in principled\n humanitarian action.\n7\n At the time of writing, only USAID and GIZ had publicly available guidelines on responsible data sharing. See USAID, 2019. Considerations for using\n data responsibly at USAID and GIZ, 2018. GIZ’s Responsible Data Principles.\n8 Willits-King, B. and Spencer, A., 2020. Responsible data-sharing with donors: accountability, transparency and data protection in principled\n humanitarian action.\nIn addition, sharing seemingly innocuous data such as aggregated survey results can place already\nvulnerable people and communities at greater risk. What may be initially considered non-personal data3\ncan allow for re-identification of individuals, communities and demographic groups. Re-identification\noccurs when data can be traced back or linked to an individual(s) or group(s) of individuals because it is not\nadequately anonymized. This can result in a violation of data protection, privacy and other human rights\nand can allow for targeting of individuals or groups with violence or other forms of harm.4\nMany donors and humanitarian actors recognize the risks and benefits associated with sharing such\nsensitive data, but the sector has yet to establish a common understanding of how to balance these risks\nand benefits effectively. Recent efforts to address this issue have led to more clarity on current practices,\nas well as on the objectives and constraints of data sharing. In September 2020, the Government of\nSwitzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Office for\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) Centre for Humanitarian Data (the Centre) organized a\nvirtual Wilton Park dialogue to help build common understanding on this issue.5\nThis guidance note synthesizes the outcomes of this dialogue and a related desk review.6\n It describes the\nchallenges around sharing sensitive data with donors and offers initial recommendations for how donors\nand humanitarian organizations can more effectively navigate this area.\nDONOR REQUESTS FOR DATA\nDonors regularly request data from their partners in order to fulfil different obligations and objectives.\nThese requests can be either formal or informal.\n• Formal requests tend to be included in grant agreements in relation to reporting criteria, and are\ntypically based on legal requirements such as compliance with counter-terrorism laws. Such requests\ntend to be negotiated at the outset of a partnership or grant agreement, and are usually made in\nwriting and scheduled in advance.\n• Informal requests concern information or data that typically fall outside of the normal scope  of\nreporting. These ad-hoc requests often carry implicit value, meaning that while they are not\nformally required, delivering this supplementary data is deemed beneficial for an organization’s\nongoing engagement and partnership with a donor. These requests represent a greater dilemma for\nhumanitarian actors.\nFew donors have formal data sharing policies or guidelines in place.7\n There is also a lack of shared\nunderstanding of terminology and of the objectives and risks around data sharing. There are different\ndefinitions and understanding of data-related risks, leading to inconsistent and sometimes contradictory\npractices around sharing potentially sensitive data with donors in a particular context.8\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 3\n9 See NRC's Toolkit for Principled Humanitarian Action; Managing CT Risks.\n10 In order to ensure compliance, donors might request highly disaggregated data to corroborate their due diligence processes, ensuring their partners\n are not engaging with any ‘sanctioned’ person or entity’. See Walker, J., 2020. Compliance Dialogue on Syria-Related Humanitarian Payments.\n ‘Sanctioned persons’ is a general term which may include individuals, terrorist groups, governments as well as companies and other entities of legal\n personality. The EU, for example, has over the years considerably strengthened its legal framework for preventing money laundering and terrorism\n financing in recent years and is constantly enforcing in. See: NGO Voice, 2020. The Impact of EU Sanctions and Restrictive Measures on\n Humanitarian Action.\n11 Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Humanitarian Financing Task Team (HFTT), 2016. Donor Conditions and their implications for\n humanitarian response.\n12 Publish What You Fund, 2020. Data Use Capacity in Protracted Humanitarian Crises.\nCONSTRAINTS FOR DATA SHARING WITH DONORS\nDespite these objectives, data sharing with donors is not without its constraints, which include a lack of\nregulatory frameworks for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data, capacity gaps and lack of\npurpose limitation.\nLack of regulatory frameworks for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data\nThe sensitivity of personal data is generally well-known and addressed by a variety of policy and regulatory\nframeworks, but the same cannot be said for sensitive non-personal data. Protecting groups and their\ndata remains challenging due to the current gaps in regulation and guidance and the overall lack of\nunderstanding regarding the sensitivity of non-personal data. These data policy gaps increase the risk of\nsensitive data not being stored or protected adequately or shared inadvertently by partners in order to\nsatisfy donors’ requests.\nCapacity gaps\nResponding to ad-hoc data sharing requests from donors can be viewed as an additional burden to\nhumanitarian responders, diverting critical time, resources and focus away from other implementing\nactivities.11 Insufficient funding for data-related capacity development has limited many organizations’\nability to provide their staff with the skills and resources required for managing data responsibly.12 Gaps\nin capacity to fulfil donor requirements might also deter smaller and/or local NGOs from seeking funding,\nundermining localization efforts.13\nOBJECTIVES FOR DATA SHARING WITH DONORS\nThe most commonly identified objectives for donors requesting sensitive data from partners are\nsituational awareness and programme design; accountability and transparency; and legal, regulatory, and\npolicy requirements.\nSituational awareness and programme design\nDonors seek information and data from humanitarian organizations in order to understand and react\nto changes in humanitarian contexts. This allows donors to improve their own programme design and\nevaluation, prevent duplication of assistance, identify information gaps, and ensure appropriate targeting\nof assistance.\nAccountability and transparency\nDonors and humanitarian organizations have an obligation to account for their activities. Data can enable\ndonors to explain and defend funding on foreign aid to taxpayers.\nLegal, regulatory, and policy requirements\nDonors are subject to certain national and international legal requirements, including political, legal and\nstatutory requirements related to counter-terrorism, migration and law enforcement. In many cases,\ndonors might want to use data to verify their compliance with these different requirements. Some donors\ninclude counterterrorism clauses in their grant agreements, which are intended to ensure that their funds\nare not used to benefit designated terrorist groups.9\n Similarly, donors might include clauses to cover antibribery, anti-fraud and anti-corruption measures.10\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 4\n14 ICRC, 2020. Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action.\n15 Examples include the Good Humanitarian Donorship Initiative and the Grand Bargain.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nIn view of the objectives and constraints detailed above, the Centre, the Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG)\nat ODI, the ICRC, and the Human Security Division of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs\nrecommend that donors and humanitarian organizations take the following steps to minimize risks while\nmaximizing benefits when sharing sensitive data:\n• Reviewing and clarifying the formal or informal frameworks that govern the collection and\nsharing of disaggregated data\nDonors and partners should examine the official, formal requirements and ad-hoc, informal\nrequirements of data sharing, and analyse partner and donor staff interpret whether requirements\ncorrectly and consistently. They should assess whether there are implicit conditionalities between the\nwillingness to share disaggregated data and the ability of different organizations to access and sustain\nfunding from donors.\n• Formalizing and standardizing requests for sensitive data\nWhen sensitive data is required to meet a mutually agreed objective, donors should formalize and\nstandardize their requests for such data. Requests should be made in writing and should specify\nwhich data is requested, the format desired, and the intended use of the data. Donors should only\nrequest the information required to meet the specified purpose for which it is being requested and\nshould indicate a timeline for destruction of the data. Humanitarian organisations should document\nall requests for data and ensure consistency in responding to these requests over time.\n• Investing in data management capacities of staff and organizations\nDonors and humanitarian organizations should identify opportunities to invest in building data\nmanagement expertise especially for non-technical staff. The donor community is uniquely positioned\nto encourage data responsibility by providing additional resources for training and capacity building.\n• Adopting common principles for donor data management\nThe sector already has a range of principles and commitments to inform different aspects of\nhumanitarian donorship.15 However, these do not sufficiently address concerns related to data\nresponsibility. Donors and partners should engage in the development of common principles and\nguidelines for donor data sharing to fill this gap. The Humanitarian Data and Trust Initiative, co-led\nby the Government of Switzerland, the ICRC, and the Centre, offers a platform to facilitate this process\nas part of its ongoing work to build trust through dialogue.\nOrganizations are encouraged to share their experience in responsible data sharing with donors with the\nCentre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.\nPurpose limitation\nThe principle of purpose limitation requires that data is only collected for specified, explicit and legitimate\npurposes, and that it not be processed further in a manner that would be incompatible with those\npurposes.14 Even when donors specify legitimate reasons for requesting data in-line with the original\npurposes for which the data was collected (e.g. the delivery of humanitarian assistance), it can be difficult\nto ensure that the data will not be used for other purposes once shared. Data used out of context and for\npurposes that are not known at the time of sharing, or retained past the intended retention for a defined\npurpose represents a violation, even if unintended, of the data subjects’ rights.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 5\nThis project is co-funded\nby the European Union\nThis document covers humanitarian aid activities implemented with the financial assistance of the\nEuropean Union.

This is not a new phenomenon; the need for\naccountability and transparency in the use of donor funding is broadly understood and respected. However,\nin recent years, donors have begun requesting data that can be sensitive. This includes personal data about\nbeneficiaries and various forms of disaggregated data, such as household-level survey results and data\nabout the delivery of assistance disaggregated by demographic and/or group dimensions (e.g. ethnicity,\nprotection group, etc.).1\nConcerns around requests for such data have led donors and humanitarian organizations to place more\nemphasis on identifying strategies for data responsibility: the safe, ethical and effective management\nof data. Data responsibility requires donors and humanitarian organizations to take actions that help\nminimize risks while maximizing benefits of data. This is particularly challenging in cases where donors\nrequest sensitive data. For example, the screening of aid recipients, which is often used to justify requests\nfor personal data, is not only difficult to practically implement, but also highly problematic in terms of\nprincipled aid.2\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 2\n3\n Non-personal data is defined as data which was initially personal data, but later made anonymous, such as data about the people affected by the\n humanitarian situation and their needs, the threats and vulnerabilities they face, and their capacities (adapted from Regulation (EU)\n 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the\n European Union).\n4\n See the Working Draft OCHA Guidelines for Data Responsibility and the ICRC Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action.\n5\n Read more about the virtual dialogue in this Wilton Park Report.\n6 Willits-King, B. and Spencer, A., 2020.

Background\nThis document summarizes the documentation and ndings developed in the peer review of the\nAnticipatory Action Trigger for Drought in Niger. The trigger mechanism was designed for an\nanticipatory action framework coordinated by OCHA. The goal of the trigger mechanism is to\ndetect increased drought risk in Niger and trigger the release of funds from the Central\nEmergency Response Fund in anticipation of drought-related humanitarian needs. The release\nof funds can be triggered from six months ahead of the rainy season (which runs from July\nthrough September) until one month into the season. The trigger mechanism includes a\npredictive model that uses seasonal precipitation forecasts and an observational model that\nuses the Standardized Precipitation Index.\nThe review was conducted between May 2022 and January 2023.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nThe documentation describing the model and its application, as well as the outcomes of the\nreview process, are available through the following links:\n● The Model Card describes version 1 of the trigger mechanism. It was completed by\nOCHA in June 2022 and updated in October 2022.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix presents the outcomes of the technical review and was\ncompleted by Mohammad Shamsudduha, Associate Professor in Humanitarian Science\nat the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London, in December\n2022.\n● The Implementation Plan summarizes the concrete actions that the trigger mechanism\nwill inform and was developed by OCHA in October 2022.\n● The Ethical Matrix identies issues that may come up in the implementation of the\ntrigger mechanism and stakeholders that may be impacted by those issues. The Ethical\nMatrix was completed in January 2023 by Andrea Romaoli Garcia, ITU Topic Driver on\nOpen Code.\nThe sections below provide a summary of the main ndings and recommendations developed in\nthe review.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The intended use of the predictive model is appropriate.\n● The model may not detect localized rainfall shortages, which could lead to the model\nmissing a trigger where it should detect increased drought risk. In addition, crop failure\ndepends on a number of factors other than rainfall, including the use and availability of\ngroundwater for irrigation as well as changes in temperature. The fact that these\nadditional factors are not included in the model should be considered in the\ninterpretation of model outputs.\nModel Development and Documentation\n● The resolution of the spatial coverage of the predictive model is very high at 0.05\ndegrees. The predictive model produces outputs on a monthly basis. The geographic\nscope of the predictive model includes the entire country of Niger. These parameters are\nappropriate for a national-scale model.\n● The spatial resolution of the predictive model at 0.05 degrees is too high given that the\npredictive model is primarily dependent on precipitation variability. Correlation between\nforecasts and observational rainfall data produced by CHIRPS is weak in Maradi and\nNiamey regions, where the irrigation is the highest in the country.\nModel Evaluation\n● The predictive model is evaluated using accuracy, hit rate, miss rate, false positives and\nfalse negatives as parameters. These model evaluation criteria are appropriate for this\npredictive model.\n● A comparison between the predictive model outputs and NextGen forecasts was based\nonly on CHIRPS gridded rainfall data. No detailed information is provided on the\ndownscaling of the forecasts and evaluation of the downscaled technique.\nOperational Readiness\n● Activities and funding are provided on a “no-regrets” basis after a trigger activation.\nActivities and funding are purposefully selected to still be valuable in the absence of a\nshock. The addition of an observational trigger based on SPI is a strength of this\nanticipatory trigger mechanism.\n● The forecast accuracy could be improved if the predictive model is tailored to individual\nareas within Niger.\n● There is little mention of local/national capacity building or strengthening in the process.\n● The performance of the predictive model should be evaluated against the observational\nmodel outputs to better understand the weaknesses in the predictive model.\nStrengthening the predictive model outputs increases the potential impact of the trigger\nmechanism due to the increased lead time.\n● The low or even negative correlation between the predictive model outputs and CHIRPS\nprecipitation in the northern part of Niger should be examined to improve the\nperformance and validity of the predictive model.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nFalse negative activation (non-activation in the presence of a shock)\n● A false negative would deprive the community of timely aid.\n● Recommendation: The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously evaluated\nagainst the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS precipitation data to\nlower the likelihood of false negatives.\nFalse positive activation (activation in the absence of a shock)\n● A false positive would increase the risk of wasted nancial resources. Such error could\nundermine the condence of stakeholders and donors and could lead to discontinuation\nof the trigger mechanism. A false negative primarily impacts other stakeholders,\nincluding local NGOs, the model developers and UN entities, due to the misallocation of\nresources. It also undermines trust in the trigger mechanism.\n● Recommendation: A false positive is more tolerable compared to a false negative, as a\nfalse positive triggers activities and funding that benet the population even in the\nabsence of a shock. The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously\nevaluated against the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS\nprecipitation data to lower the likelihood of false positives.\nIdentity exposure (exposure of individual identities through potential use of additional data\nsources in implementation of the model)\n● Unauthorized access to any personal data used in future implementation of the trigger\nmechanism could cause harm and carries reputational risk.\n● Recommendation: Given that the trigger mechanism does not include the use of any\npersonal data there is little concern that a data breach could result in re-identication. If\nthe implementation of the trigger mechanism evolves over time to include additional\npersonal data, the tools and infrastructure used in implementation should be\nre-evaluated and adjusted as needed to mitigate the risk of identity exposure.\nBias in available data\n● Bias in data availability resulting from gaps in data for different regions in Niger could\naffect the allocation of funding and activities.\n● Recommendation: Determine whether there are gaps resulting in biases in climate data\navailability for Niger in order to prevent unfair allocation of funding and activities.\nFeedback\nThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic, research and\nprivate sector to engage with us on the peer review process. Please send feedback on the Peer Review\nFramework to centrehumdata@un.org."

These events can exploit or exacerbate existing\nvulnerabilities.1\n In some cases, they may also create new vulnerabilities that can increase the risk of future\ndata incidents.\nHumanitarians have not had a common understanding of what comprises a data incident, nor is there\na minimum technical standard for how these incidents should be prevented and managed. How the\nhumanitarian sector develops tools and implements procedures for data incident management will play\na significant role in the evolution of the ethical, human rights, technical, and professional standards of\nhumanitarian operations.\n1 “A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by\n a threat source.” NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\nGUIDANCE NOTE SERIES\nDATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION\nDATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n• Humanitarian data incidents are events involving the management of data that have caused\nharm or have the potential to cause harm to crisis-affected people, organizations and their\noperations, and other individuals or groups.\n• Examples of humanitarian data incidents include physical breaches of infrastructure,\nunauthorised disclosure of data, and the use of beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes,\namong others.\n• A data incident has four aspects: (i) a threat source, (ii) a threat event, (iii) a vulnerability and (iv)\nan adverse impact.\n• There are five steps to responding to data incidents: (i) notification, (ii) classification, (iii)\ntreatment, and (iv) closure of the incident, as well as (v) learning.\n“If aid actors digitize more of their data and communications, they urgently\n need to increase their digital security efforts. Though some actors are\n developing promising protective tools, aid organizations overall might be\n well advised to listen to a quote from IT-security circles: ‘There are two\n types of organizations: those who have been hacked, and those who will be.”\n- Rahel Dette, Do No Digital Harm: Mitigating Technology Risk in Humanitarian Contexts\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 2\nDEFINITIONS AND FRAMEWORKS FOR UNDERSTANDING DATA INCIDENTS\nGovernments and the private sector have developed definitions and frameworks for understanding data\nincidents that serve as helpful references for the humanitarian sector.\n• The International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) in ISO Standard 27000 defines a ‘critical\nincident’ as “a single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information security events that have a\nsignificant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security.”2\n• The United States Department of Commerce National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)\ndefines an adverse event involving a ‘cyber threat’ as “[a]n event or condition that has the potential\nfor causing asset loss and the undesirable consequences or impact from such loss.”3\n• Mahmood Sher-Jan of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) identifies three\nadditional categories of events that expand upon the NIST definition of adverse events. These are, in\norder of escalating severity: security incidents; privacy incidents; and data breaches.4\n2 International Organization for Standardization, ISO/IEC 27000:2018.\n3 NIST Computer Security Resource Center Glossary.\n4 IAPP, Is It an Incident or a Breach, How to Tell and Why It Matters, Mahmoud Sher-Jan (February 2017).\n5 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nHumanitarian data incidents may include physical breaches of infrastructure, unauthorised disclosure of\ndata, and the use of ‘anonymised’ beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes, among others. Data\nincidents can also occur without technical infrastructure being compromised in any way. The legitimate\ncollection, use, and sharing of data by humanitarians can still have operational implications that may\nconstitute a data incident in cases where rumors, cultural sensitivities, political dynamics, and other\nfactors lead to adverse effects linked to the data.\nExamples of possible humanitarian data incidents\nA data incident has four factors: a threat source, a threat event, a vulnerability and an adverse impact.5\nBelow are two types of hypothetical data incidents that could occur in humanitarian contexts.\nThe first scenario is a typical data breach incident situated in the context of an armed conflict. The\nsecond is an example of the type of vulnerabilities that can initiate data incidents unique to the\nhumanitarian sector.\n1. Unauthorized access to data occurs [impact] due to armed actors [source] raiding a facility and\nseizing hard-drives containing beneficiary data [event]. The hard-drives were unencrypted\n[vulnerability].\n2. Absence of guidance limiting data collection for a specific purpose [vulnerability] leads to staff\ncollecting data about the marital status of pregnant women [source]. A data breach [event] later\noccurs, resulting in an increased chance of physical violence [impact] against unwed pregnant\nbeneficiaries.\nThese scenarios demonstrate how to think about identifying causal chains that may create contextspecific data incidents. \nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 3\n6 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nRISK MODELS\nThe figure below presents a generic risk model with risk factors that organizations can use to understand\nhow a data incident may occur. A threat event exploits an existing vulnerability that is either magnified by\npredisposing conditions or mitigated by security controls already in place. This causes adverse impacts that\nproduce organizational risk, which can include risks for the organization and for affected people.\nFigure 1. “Generic Risk Model with Key Risk Factors”. Source: NIST Special Publication\n800-30 pg. 126\nThe figure below presents one example of how this generic risk model could be adapted to the\nhumanitarian sector.\nFigure 2. Risk Model with Key Risk Factors adapted to a humanitarian context.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 4\nHumanitarian organizations can develop their own specific risk models for data incident management\nincorporating these factors. The nature of these risk factors and how they come together to constitute a\ndata incident will vary from one organization to another and should be adapted to specific operational\nrealities.\nSTEPS IN DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nAfter clearly defining what constitutes a data incident, organizations can develop Standard Operating\nProcedures (SOPs) for data incident management.\nData incident management SOPs should include the following 5 steps: 1) notification, 2) classification;\n3) treatment; 4) closure; and 5) knowledge base.7\n7 The Centre for Humanitarian Data provides several sources of guidance that can inform the development of Data Incident Management SOPs on\n the Data Responsibility page.\n8 How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16, Antonio Jose Segovia, (October 2015.).\n9 For humanitarian organizations, an example of such a classification is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of\n Patient Safety, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\n10 WHO, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\nFigure 3: Five steps in the treatment of security incidents (Source: How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16,\nAntonio Jose Segovia8\nThe application of these steps in an organization can look as follows:\n1. Notification of the incident: A person detects an incident and notifies relevant colleagues according\nto the communication procedures of the organization (usually an email, a phone call, a software tool,\netc.). A notification should contain, if possible, a description of the key risk factors involved in the\nincident: source, event, vulnerability and impact.\n2. Classification of the incident: The recipient of the notification classifies the incident based on it’s\nimpact (high, medium or low) and the urgency of treatment (high, medium or low).9\n Managing risk\nbegins with classifying all incidents, whether or not tangible harm actually results from them.10\n3. Treatment of the incident: A technical expert decides on the necessary measures to treat the incident\nonce the incident has been classified and the time for treatment has been agreed.\n4. Closure of the incident: All information generated during the treatment is recorded and the person\nwho first sent notification of the incident is informed that the incident is closed.\n5. Knowledge base: All information generated during the treatment of the incident is used to inform and\ntrain colleagues and as reference material for future similar incidents.\nHumanitarian organizations can base their SOPs on this 5-step model, describing how each step should\ntake place within their organization. This should include the functions/roles and teams within an\norganization that are responsible at each stage of the process. These steps should be incorporated into\nor extended from existing incident response protocols (e.g. security incident management related to\nhumanitarian access).\nIn a given response context, organizations should also work to integrate any joint incident management\nprocedures into existing coordination structures, such as the clusters and mechanisms for inter- and\nintra-cluster coordination.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 5\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT IN\nHUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS\nIntroducing or improving data incident management in humanitarian operations is critical to more\nresponsible data practice in the sector. The Centre for Humanitarian Data recommends that organizations\nfocus on the following areas:\n1. Establish a common understanding of data incident management\nUse a risk model to understand the causal chain that can lead to data incidents for specific offices and\nsystems. Identify key threat actors and vulnerabilities for offices and systems and understand existing\nsecurity controls and their effectiveness. Finally, map existing data incident management capacity\nand determine whether it is positioned appropriately. Once clear definitions and processes are\narticulated, invest in staff awareness and support a culture of open dialogue about incidents, in which\nproactive reporting and management of incidents is incentivized, not punished.\n2. Strengthen data incident management capacity\nTake measures to put in place security controls to mitigate the risk of data incidents, and share best\npractice with partners. Build on existing work in the sector to fill governance gaps which can create\nvulnerabilities for your organization. Engage with organizational partners to set up information\nchannels around data incidents. Share known vulnerabilities in a controlled manner with trusted\ncounterparts for cross-organizational learning.\n3. Support continuous learning\nSupport learning and development of improved data incident management practices by organizing\ntraining and drills based on scenarios likely to occur in different operational settings. These exercises\nshould occur regularly and may even involve multiple organizations training and drilling together. In\naddition, document actual data incidents as cases for internal knowledge development.\nOrganizations are encouraged to share their experience in the development of data incident management\nwith the Centre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.\nThis project is co-funded\nby the European Union\nThis document covers humanitarian aid activities implemented with the financial assistance of the\nEuropean Union. The views expressed herein should not be taken, in any way, to reflect the official opinion\nof the European Union, and the European Commission is not responsible for any use that may be made of\nthe information it contains.\nCOLLABORATORS: YALE UNIVERSITY, JACKSON INSTITUTE OF GLOBAL AFFAIRS.\nThe Centre for Humanitarian Data (‘the Centre’), together with key partners, is publishing a series of eight\nguidance notes on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action over the course of 2019 and 2020.

Some of these requests relate to sensitive information and data which needs to\nbe protected in order to mitigate risk.\n• Common objectives for data sharing with donors include: (i) situational awareness and\nprogramme design; (ii) accountability and transparency; and (iii) legal, regulatory, and policy\nrequirements.\n• Common constraints related to sharing data with donors include: (i) lack of regulatory framework\nfor responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data; (ii) capacity gaps; and (iii) purpose\nlimitation.\n• Donors and humanitarian organizations can take the following steps to minimize risks while\nmaximizing benefits when sharing sensitive data: (i) reviewing and clarifying the formal or\ninformal frameworks that govern the collection and sharing of disaggregated data; (ii) formalizing\nand standardising requests for sensitive data; (iii) investing in data management capacities of\nstaff and organisations; and (iv) adopting common principles for donor data management.\nINTRODUCTION\nDonors have an important role in the humanitarian data ecosystem, both as drivers of increased data\ncollection and analysis, and as direct users of data. This is not a new phenomenon; the need for\naccountability and transparency in the use of donor funding is broadly understood and respected. However,\nin recent years, donors have begun requesting data that can be sensitive. This includes personal data about\nbeneficiaries and various forms of disaggregated data, such as household-level survey results and data\nabout the delivery of assistance disaggregated by demographic and/or group dimensions (e.g. ethnicity,\nprotection group, etc.).1\nConcerns around requests for such data have led donors and humanitarian organizations to place more\nemphasis on identifying strategies for data responsibility: the safe, ethical and effective management\nof data. Data responsibility requires donors and humanitarian organizations to take actions that help\nminimize risks while maximizing benefits of data. This is particularly challenging in cases where donors\nrequest sensitive data. For example, the screening of aid recipients, which is often used to justify requests\nfor personal data, is not only difficult to practically implement, but also highly problematic in terms of\nprincipled aid.2\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 2\n3\n Non-personal data is defined as data which was initially personal data, but later made anonymous, such as data about the people affected by the\n humanitarian situation and their needs, the threats and vulnerabilities they face, and their capacities (adapted from Regulation (EU)\n 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the\n European Union).\n4\n See the Working Draft OCHA Guidelines for Data Responsibility and the ICRC Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action.\n5\n Read more about the virtual dialogue in this Wilton Park Report.\n6 Willits-King, B. and Spencer, A., 2020. Responsible data-sharing with donors: accountability, transparency and data protection in principled\n humanitarian action.\n7\n At the time of writing, only USAID and GIZ had publicly available guidelines on responsible data sharing. See USAID, 2019. Considerations for using\n data responsibly at USAID and GIZ, 2018. GIZ’s Responsible Data Principles.\n8 Willits-King, B. and Spencer, A., 2020. Responsible data-sharing with donors: accountability, transparency and data protection in principled\n humanitarian action.\nIn addition, sharing seemingly innocuous data such as aggregated survey results can place already\nvulnerable people and communities at greater risk. What may be initially considered non-personal data3\ncan allow for re-identification of individuals, communities and demographic groups. Re-identification\noccurs when data can be traced back or linked to an individual(s) or group(s) of individuals because it is not\nadequately anonymized. This can result in a violation of data protection, privacy and other human rights\nand can allow for targeting of individuals or groups with violence or other forms of harm.4\nMany donors and humanitarian actors recognize the risks and benefits associated with sharing such\nsensitive data, but the sector has yet to establish a common understanding of how to balance these risks\nand benefits effectively. Recent efforts to address this issue have led to more clarity on current practices,\nas well as on the objectives and constraints of data sharing. In September 2020, the Government of\nSwitzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Office for\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) Centre for Humanitarian Data (the Centre) organized a\nvirtual Wilton Park dialogue to help build common understanding on this issue.5\nThis guidance note synthesizes the outcomes of this dialogue and a related desk review.6\n It describes the\nchallenges around sharing sensitive data with donors and offers initial recommendations for how donors\nand humanitarian organizations can more effectively navigate this area.\nDONOR REQUESTS FOR DATA\nDonors regularly request data from their partners in order to fulfil different obligations and objectives.\nThese requests can be either formal or informal.\n• Formal requests tend to be included in grant agreements in relation to reporting criteria, and are\ntypically based on legal requirements such as compliance with counter-terrorism laws. Such requests\ntend to be negotiated at the outset of a partnership or grant agreement, and are usually made in\nwriting and scheduled in advance.\n• Informal requests concern information or data that typically fall outside of the normal scope  of\nreporting. These ad-hoc requests often carry implicit value, meaning that while they are not\nformally required, delivering this supplementary data is deemed beneficial for an organization’s\nongoing engagement and partnership with a donor. These requests represent a greater dilemma for\nhumanitarian actors.\nFew donors have formal data sharing policies or guidelines in place.7\n There is also a lack of shared\nunderstanding of terminology and of the objectives and risks around data sharing. There are different\ndefinitions and understanding of data-related risks, leading to inconsistent and sometimes contradictory\npractices around sharing potentially sensitive data with donors in a particular context.8\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 3\n9 See NRC's Toolkit for Principled Humanitarian Action; Managing CT Risks.\n10 In order to ensure compliance, donors might request highly disaggregated data to corroborate their due diligence processes, ensuring their partners\n are not engaging with any ‘sanctioned’ person or entity’. See Walker, J., 2020. Compliance Dialogue on Syria-Related Humanitarian Payments.\n ‘Sanctioned persons’ is a general term which may include individuals, terrorist groups, governments as well as companies and other entities of legal\n personality. The EU, for example, has over the years considerably strengthened its legal framework for preventing money laundering and terrorism\n financing in recent years and is constantly enforcing in. See: NGO Voice, 2020. The Impact of EU Sanctions and Restrictive Measures on\n Humanitarian Action.\n11 Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Humanitarian Financing Task Team (HFTT), 2016. Donor Conditions and their implications for\n humanitarian response.\n12 Publish What You Fund, 2020. Data Use Capacity in Protracted Humanitarian Crises.\nCONSTRAINTS FOR DATA SHARING WITH DONORS\nDespite these objectives, data sharing with donors is not without its constraints, which include a lack of\nregulatory frameworks for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data, capacity gaps and lack of\npurpose limitation.\nLack of regulatory frameworks for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data\nThe sensitivity of personal data is generally well-known and addressed by a variety of policy and regulatory\nframeworks, but the same cannot be said for sensitive non-personal data. Protecting groups and their\ndata remains challenging due to the current gaps in regulation and guidance and the overall lack of\nunderstanding regarding the sensitivity of non-personal data. These data policy gaps increase the risk of\nsensitive data not being stored or protected adequately or shared inadvertently by partners in order to\nsatisfy donors’ requests.\nCapacity gaps\nResponding to ad-hoc data sharing requests from donors can be viewed as an additional burden to\nhumanitarian responders, diverting critical time, resources and focus away from other implementing\nactivities.11 Insufficient funding for data-related capacity development has limited many organizations’\nability to provide their staff with the skills and resources required for managing data responsibly.12 Gaps\nin capacity to fulfil donor requirements might also deter smaller and/or local NGOs from seeking funding,\nundermining localization efforts.13\nOBJECTIVES FOR DATA SHARING WITH DONORS\nThe most commonly identified objectives for donors requesting sensitive data from partners are\nsituational awareness and programme design; accountability and transparency; and legal, regulatory, and\npolicy requirements.\nSituational awareness and programme design\nDonors seek information and data from humanitarian organizations in order to understand and react\nto changes in humanitarian contexts. This allows donors to improve their own programme design and\nevaluation, prevent duplication of assistance, identify information gaps, and ensure appropriate targeting\nof assistance.\nAccountability and transparency\nDonors and humanitarian organizations have an obligation to account for their activities. Data can enable\ndonors to explain and defend funding on foreign aid to taxpayers.\nLegal, regulatory, and policy requirements\nDonors are subject to certain national and international legal requirements, including political, legal and\nstatutory requirements related to counter-terrorism, migration and law enforcement. In many cases,\ndonors might want to use data to verify their compliance with these different requirements. Some donors\ninclude counterterrorism clauses in their grant agreements, which are intended to ensure that their funds\nare not used to benefit designated terrorist groups.9\n Similarly, donors might include clauses to cover antibribery, anti-fraud and anti-corruption measures.10\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 4\n14 ICRC, 2020. Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action.\n15 Examples include the Good Humanitarian Donorship Initiative and the Grand Bargain.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nIn view of the objectives and constraints detailed above, the Centre, the Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG)\nat ODI, the ICRC, and the Human Security Division of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs\nrecommend that donors and humanitarian organizations take the following steps to minimize risks while\nmaximizing benefits when sharing sensitive data:\n• Reviewing and clarifying the formal or informal frameworks that govern the collection and\nsharing of disaggregated data\nDonors and partners should examine the official, formal requirements and ad-hoc, informal\nrequirements of data sharing, and analyse partner and donor staff interpret whether requirements\ncorrectly and consistently. They should assess whether there are implicit conditionalities between the\nwillingness to share disaggregated data and the ability of different organizations to access and sustain\nfunding from donors.\n• Formalizing and standardizing requests for sensitive data\nWhen sensitive data is required to meet a mutually agreed objective, donors should formalize and\nstandardize their requests for such data. Requests should be made in writing and should specify\nwhich data is requested, the format desired, and the intended use of the data. Donors should only\nrequest the information required to meet the specified purpose for which it is being requested and\nshould indicate a timeline for destruction of the data. Humanitarian organisations should document\nall requests for data and ensure consistency in responding to these requests over time.\n• Investing in data management capacities of staff and organizations\nDonors and humanitarian organizations should identify opportunities to invest in building data\nmanagement expertise especially for non-technical staff. The donor community is uniquely positioned\nto encourage data responsibility by providing additional resources for training and capacity building.\n• Adopting common principles for donor data management\nThe sector already has a range of principles and commitments to inform different aspects of\nhumanitarian donorship.15 However, these do not sufficiently address concerns related to data\nresponsibility. Donors and partners should engage in the development of common principles and\nguidelines for donor data sharing to fill this gap. The Humanitarian Data and Trust Initiative, co-led\nby the Government of Switzerland, the ICRC, and the Centre, offers a platform to facilitate this process\nas part of its ongoing work to build trust through dialogue.\nOrganizations are encouraged to share their experience in responsible data sharing with donors with the\nCentre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.\nPurpose limitation\nThe principle of purpose limitation requires that data is only collected for specified, explicit and legitimate\npurposes, and that it not be processed further in a manner that would be incompatible with those\npurposes.14 Even when donors specify legitimate reasons for requesting data in-line with the original\npurposes for which the data was collected (e.g. the delivery of humanitarian assistance), it can be difficult\nto ensure that the data will not be used for other purposes once shared. Data used out of context and for\npurposes that are not known at the time of sharing, or retained past the intended retention for a defined\npurpose represents a violation, even if unintended, of the data subjects’ rights.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 5\nThis project is co-funded\nby the European Union\nThis document covers humanitarian aid activities implemented with the financial assistance of the\nEuropean Union.

These data policy gaps increase the risk of\nsensitive data not being stored or protected adequately or shared inadvertently by partners in order to\nsatisfy donors’ requests.\nCapacity gaps\nResponding to ad-hoc data sharing requests from donors can be viewed as an additional burden to\nhumanitarian responders, diverting critical time, resources and focus away from other implementing\nactivities.11 Insufficient funding for data-related capacity development has limited many organizations’\nability to provide their staff with the skills and resources required for managing data responsibly.12 Gaps\nin capacity to fulfil donor requirements might also deter smaller and/or local NGOs from seeking funding,\nundermining localization efforts.13\nOBJECTIVES FOR DATA SHARING WITH DONORS\nThe most commonly identified objectives for donors requesting sensitive data from partners are\nsituational awareness and programme design; accountability and transparency; and legal, regulatory, and\npolicy requirements.\nSituational awareness and programme design\nDonors seek information and data from humanitarian organizations in order to understand and react\nto changes in humanitarian contexts. This allows donors to improve their own programme design and\nevaluation, prevent duplication of assistance, identify information gaps, and ensure appropriate targeting\nof assistance.\nAccountability and transparency\nDonors and humanitarian organizations have an obligation to account for their activities. Data can enable\ndonors to explain and defend funding on foreign aid to taxpayers.\nLegal, regulatory, and policy requirements\nDonors are subject to certain national and international legal requirements, including political, legal and\nstatutory requirements related to counter-terrorism, migration and law enforcement. In many cases,\ndonors might want to use data to verify their compliance with these different requirements. Some donors\ninclude counterterrorism clauses in their grant agreements, which are intended to ensure that their funds\nare not used to benefit designated terrorist groups.9\n Similarly, donors might include clauses to cover antibribery, anti-fraud and anti-corruption measures.10\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 4\n14 ICRC, 2020. Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action.\n15 Examples include the Good Humanitarian Donorship Initiative and the Grand Bargain.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nIn view of the objectives and constraints detailed above, the Centre, the Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG)\nat ODI, the ICRC, and the Human Security Division of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs\nrecommend that donors and humanitarian organizations take the following steps to minimize risks while\nmaximizing benefits when sharing sensitive data:\n• Reviewing and clarifying the formal or informal frameworks that govern the collection and\nsharing of disaggregated data\nDonors and partners should examine the official, formal requirements and ad-hoc, informal\nrequirements of data sharing, and analyse partner and donor staff interpret whether requirements\ncorrectly and consistently. They should assess whether there are implicit conditionalities between the\nwillingness to share disaggregated data and the ability of different organizations to access and sustain\nfunding from donors.\n• Formalizing and standardizing requests for sensitive data\nWhen sensitive data is required to meet a mutually agreed objective, donors should formalize and\nstandardize their requests for such data. Requests should be made in writing and should specify\nwhich data is requested, the format desired, and the intended use of the data. Donors should only\nrequest the information required to meet the specified purpose for which it is being requested and\nshould indicate a timeline for destruction of the data. Humanitarian organisations should document\nall requests for data and ensure consistency in responding to these requests over time.\n• Investing in data management capacities of staff and organizations\nDonors and humanitarian organizations should identify opportunities to invest in building data\nmanagement expertise especially for non-technical staff. The donor community is uniquely positioned\nto encourage data responsibility by providing additional resources for training and capacity building.\n• Adopting common principles for donor data management\nThe sector already has a range of principles and commitments to inform different aspects of\nhumanitarian donorship.15 However, these do not sufficiently address concerns related to data\nresponsibility. Donors and partners should engage in the development of common principles and\nguidelines for donor data sharing to fill this gap. The Humanitarian Data and Trust Initiative, co-led\nby the Government of Switzerland, the ICRC, and the Centre, offers a platform to facilitate this process\nas part of its ongoing work to build trust through dialogue.\nOrganizations are encouraged to share their experience in responsible data sharing with donors with the\nCentre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.\nPurpose limitation\nThe principle of purpose limitation requires that data is only collected for specified, explicit and legitimate\npurposes, and that it not be processed further in a manner that would be incompatible with those\npurposes.14 Even when donors specify legitimate reasons for requesting data in-line with the original\npurposes for which the data was collected (e.g. the delivery of humanitarian assistance), it can be difficult\nto ensure that the data will not be used for other purposes once shared. Data used out of context and for\npurposes that are not known at the time of sharing, or retained past the intended retention for a defined\npurpose represents a violation, even if unintended, of the data subjects’ rights.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 5\nThis project is co-funded\nby the European Union\nThis document covers humanitarian aid activities implemented with the financial assistance of the\nEuropean Union.

Background\nThis report summarises the documentation and ndings of the peer review of the trigger used in\nUN OCHA’s Burkina Faso Anticipatory Action framework for drought. The impact prediction\nmodel used as a basis for this trigger was developed by the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data\nPredictive Analytics team. The go-no-go trigger mechanism is based on the IRI seasonal rainfall\nforecast, with a threshold dependent on geographical coverage and below-average rainfall\nprobability. To nd out more, please see the Anticipatory Action Framework for Burkina Faso.\nThe review has been conducted between May and December 2022.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nYou can nd all the documentation regarding the model, its application and the review process\nat the following links:\n● The Model Card describes version 1.0 of the model and was completed in May 2022.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix was completed in July 2022 by a technical expert from the\nRed Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n● The Implementation Plan was completed in October 2022. It summarises the concrete\nactions that the model will trigger or inform as part of the 2021 OCHA anticipatory action\nframework in Burkina Faso.\n● The Ethical Matrix aims to identify all stakeholders and potential issues regarding the\nintended use of the model. The Ethical Matrix was completed by an expert from DFID in\nNovember 2022.\nA summary of the main ndings and recommendations is provided below.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The model is simple and scalable; however, an alternative source of forecast should be\nused for verication, and other drought indicators such as dry spells considered.\n● Clarication is required on the mismatch between drought return periods, and how\ngeographical targeting is performed given the coarse resolution.\nModel Development and Documentation\n● Additional verication metrics are required to increase the condence of the trigger, in\nparticular due to the limited hindcast.\n● More clarity is needed on how the minimum required area of below average precipitation\nof 10% was chosen, and the exact thresholds used across lead times and activation\nwindows should be specied.\nModel Evaluation\n● The model uncertainty was clearly communicated and accepted by stakeholders.\n● A strategy to increase model trust is lacking. For example, the methodology could be\nsubmitted to a peer-review / academic journal for review once it is more mature.\n● Discussion on potential negative risks due to interventions occurring in a\nconict-affected country is very much needed.\nOperational Readiness\n● The model was developed collaboratively and is ready to be piloted.\n● The choice of forecasting information and baseline for verication should be\nre-examined to improve trust in the trigger system.\n● More reection on the potential negative effects of a false alarm is required.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nEffectiveness: Regional Selection\nThe motivation behind the selection of targeted regions is unclear, and in particular, is missing Est,\nwhich has been identied as high-risk across several factors, including food insecurity.\n● Recommendation: Expand the explanation on the selection of the four regions, in\nparticular why Est was not included and Boucle de Mouhoun was.\nEffectiveness: Focus on Drought\nThe cause of food insecurity in Burkina Faso is linked with several factors in addition to drought,\nincluding conict, agricultural practice, supply chain disruptions and food prices.\n● Recommendation: Better justify the selection of rainfall as the sole trigger and why other\nfactors were not included.\nEffectiveness: Sub-regional Targeting\nIt is unclear if and how sub-districts with projected IPC-5 will be targeted.\n● Recommendation: Include more details on how districts and communities most in need\nwill be targeted by the UN agencies implementing the interventions.\nEciency and Feasibility: Best Use of Resources\nWith the Burkina Faso HRP being severely underfunded, it is unclear whether this anticipatory\naction pilot diverts funding away from more urgent needs identied by the Food Security Cluster.\n● Recommendation: Discuss the potential impacts that $15 million could have on the\nregion or globally and compare to the impacts of the no-regrets approach.\nEciency and Feasibility: Maximise Collective Action and Avoid Duplication\nThe rationale for the choice of model, and how it helps leverage common resources and avoid\nduplication, is lacking.\n● Recommendation: Expand the framework to discuss how the model complements\nexisting early warning and food insecurity mitigation efforts in Burkina Faso, such as\nFEWS NET and CH/IPC.\nEciency and feasibility: Risk/harm-benet Analysis\nA risk/harm-benet analysis is required to understand ethical and nancial risks and is missing\nfrom the framework.\n● Recommendation: Perform a full risk/harm-benet analysis.\nAccountability and Community Participation\nThe implementation plan makes little reference to affected communities, local organizations and\nauthorities in the design of the framework.\n● Recommendation: The framework should include activities to engage and explain the\nmodel to local civil society, affected populations and authorities.\n● Recommendation: Explain why there were no partnerships formed with ECOWAS,\nUEMOA and the RCPA.\nNeutrality, Impartiality and Conict-sensitivity\nIt is unclear how much the framework takes into account the presence of conict in the region.\n● Recommendation: Investigate the feasibility of carrying out a detailed conict sensitivity\nassessment.\nTrustworthiness and Reliability\nOutstanding questions remain on choice of forecast, and whether other options were considered.\n● Recommendation: Expand the explanation of why the IRI dataset was the only one used.\nTransparency and Explainability\nNo information on how an external actor can learn how the model works and understand the basis\nof the trigger decisions.\n● Recommendation: Amend the framework to include activities that engage and explain\nthe model to local civil society, affected populations and authorities.\nHuman in the Loop\nNo human stop mechanism specied per the recommendation of the Ethiopia evaluation.\n● Recommendation: Investigate the possibility of including a stop mechanism.\nFeedback\nThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic, research and\nprivate sector to engage with us on the peer review process.

The UN OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data worked with a wide range\nof technical partners to develop a methodology that was then endorsed by the Somalia ICCG\nand HCT.\nDaily FloodScan (1998-2022) & WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) raster data was analysed to gain\nunderstanding of ood conditions across Somalia for both March-April-May (MAM) and\nOctober-November-December (OND) seasons. FloodScan daily ood fraction Standard Flood\nExposure Depiction (SFED) was aggregated to yearly seasonal maximum fraction composites\nfor both the MAM and OND seasons for all years of historical FloodScan data (1998-2022).\nThe yearly seasonal SFED composites were then processed/reclassied in two distinct ways:\n1. Composites reclassied to binary using a 20 percent ood fraction threshold.\n2. Composites masked to just remove any ood fraction values < 0.05 percent and the\nood fraction (0-100 percent) retained.\nAll composites in both sets of processed yearly-seasonal ood fraction rasters were then\nmultiplied by the WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) population estimate raster to create two sets of\nyearly seasonal ood exposure rasters. These were then aggregated at the second\nadministrative level via zonal statistics (sum) to obtain the estimated population exposure per\ndistrict for each season across all years for each set. These estimates were converted to the\npercent of population exposed by dividing the estimates by the total population per district\n(from World Pop raster). The percent exposure gure was then applied to the updated 2024\npopulation data set (UN OCHA, UNFPA Methodology) to obtain updated population exposure\nestimates. These data were further aggregated to administrative level 1.\nRanges for exposure were estimated using percentiles for both the MAM and OND seasons per\nadministrative level. As ECMWF seasonal forecast predicts an above average precipitation\nseason for MAM 2024, the range of population exposed was based on the 50th-95th percentile\nlevels. Since there was no available data to inform predictions for OND 2024, the 25-75th\npercentile values were used to bound the range. The lower and upper limits of the ranges were\nPage 1 of 2\ncalculated at the administrative level using all of the historical yearly seasonal ood exposure\nestimates.

These events can exploit or exacerbate existing\nvulnerabilities.1\n In some cases, they may also create new vulnerabilities that can increase the risk of future\ndata incidents.\nHumanitarians have not had a common understanding of what comprises a data incident, nor is there\na minimum technical standard for how these incidents should be prevented and managed. How the\nhumanitarian sector develops tools and implements procedures for data incident management will play\na significant role in the evolution of the ethical, human rights, technical, and professional standards of\nhumanitarian operations.\n1 “A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by\n a threat source.” NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\nGUIDANCE NOTE SERIES\nDATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION\nDATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n• Humanitarian data incidents are events involving the management of data that have caused\nharm or have the potential to cause harm to crisis-affected people, organizations and their\noperations, and other individuals or groups.\n• Examples of humanitarian data incidents include physical breaches of infrastructure,\nunauthorised disclosure of data, and the use of beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes,\namong others.\n• A data incident has four aspects: (i) a threat source, (ii) a threat event, (iii) a vulnerability and (iv)\nan adverse impact.\n• There are five steps to responding to data incidents: (i) notification, (ii) classification, (iii)\ntreatment, and (iv) closure of the incident, as well as (v) learning.\n“If aid actors digitize more of their data and communications, they urgently\n need to increase their digital security efforts. Though some actors are\n developing promising protective tools, aid organizations overall might be\n well advised to listen to a quote from IT-security circles: ‘There are two\n types of organizations: those who have been hacked, and those who will be.”\n- Rahel Dette, Do No Digital Harm: Mitigating Technology Risk in Humanitarian Contexts\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 2\nDEFINITIONS AND FRAMEWORKS FOR UNDERSTANDING DATA INCIDENTS\nGovernments and the private sector have developed definitions and frameworks for understanding data\nincidents that serve as helpful references for the humanitarian sector.\n• The International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) in ISO Standard 27000 defines a ‘critical\nincident’ as “a single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information security events that have a\nsignificant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security.”2\n• The United States Department of Commerce National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)\ndefines an adverse event involving a ‘cyber threat’ as “[a]n event or condition that has the potential\nfor causing asset loss and the undesirable consequences or impact from such loss.”3\n• Mahmood Sher-Jan of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) identifies three\nadditional categories of events that expand upon the NIST definition of adverse events. These are, in\norder of escalating severity: security incidents; privacy incidents; and data breaches.4\n2 International Organization for Standardization, ISO/IEC 27000:2018.\n3 NIST Computer Security Resource Center Glossary.\n4 IAPP, Is It an Incident or a Breach, How to Tell and Why It Matters, Mahmoud Sher-Jan (February 2017).\n5 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nHumanitarian data incidents may include physical breaches of infrastructure, unauthorised disclosure of\ndata, and the use of ‘anonymised’ beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes, among others. Data\nincidents can also occur without technical infrastructure being compromised in any way. The legitimate\ncollection, use, and sharing of data by humanitarians can still have operational implications that may\nconstitute a data incident in cases where rumors, cultural sensitivities, political dynamics, and other\nfactors lead to adverse effects linked to the data.\nExamples of possible humanitarian data incidents\nA data incident has four factors: a threat source, a threat event, a vulnerability and an adverse impact.5\nBelow are two types of hypothetical data incidents that could occur in humanitarian contexts.\nThe first scenario is a typical data breach incident situated in the context of an armed conflict. The\nsecond is an example of the type of vulnerabilities that can initiate data incidents unique to the\nhumanitarian sector.\n1. Unauthorized access to data occurs [impact] due to armed actors [source] raiding a facility and\nseizing hard-drives containing beneficiary data [event]. The hard-drives were unencrypted\n[vulnerability].\n2. Absence of guidance limiting data collection for a specific purpose [vulnerability] leads to staff\ncollecting data about the marital status of pregnant women [source]. A data breach [event] later\noccurs, resulting in an increased chance of physical violence [impact] against unwed pregnant\nbeneficiaries.\nThese scenarios demonstrate how to think about identifying causal chains that may create contextspecific data incidents. \nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 3\n6 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nRISK MODELS\nThe figure below presents a generic risk model with risk factors that organizations can use to understand\nhow a data incident may occur. A threat event exploits an existing vulnerability that is either magnified by\npredisposing conditions or mitigated by security controls already in place. This causes adverse impacts that\nproduce organizational risk, which can include risks for the organization and for affected people.\nFigure 1. “Generic Risk Model with Key Risk Factors”. Source: NIST Special Publication\n800-30 pg. 126\nThe figure below presents one example of how this generic risk model could be adapted to the\nhumanitarian sector.\nFigure 2. Risk Model with Key Risk Factors adapted to a humanitarian context.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 4\nHumanitarian organizations can develop their own specific risk models for data incident management\nincorporating these factors. The nature of these risk factors and how they come together to constitute a\ndata incident will vary from one organization to another and should be adapted to specific operational\nrealities.\nSTEPS IN DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nAfter clearly defining what constitutes a data incident, organizations can develop Standard Operating\nProcedures (SOPs) for data incident management.\nData incident management SOPs should include the following 5 steps: 1) notification, 2) classification;\n3) treatment; 4) closure; and 5) knowledge base.7\n7 The Centre for Humanitarian Data provides several sources of guidance that can inform the development of Data Incident Management SOPs on\n the Data Responsibility page.\n8 How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16, Antonio Jose Segovia, (October 2015.).\n9 For humanitarian organizations, an example of such a classification is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of\n Patient Safety, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\n10 WHO, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\nFigure 3: Five steps in the treatment of security incidents (Source: How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16,\nAntonio Jose Segovia8\nThe application of these steps in an organization can look as follows:\n1. Notification of the incident: A person detects an incident and notifies relevant colleagues according\nto the communication procedures of the organization (usually an email, a phone call, a software tool,\netc.). A notification should contain, if possible, a description of the key risk factors involved in the\nincident: source, event, vulnerability and impact.\n2. Classification of the incident: The recipient of the notification classifies the incident based on it’s\nimpact (high, medium or low) and the urgency of treatment (high, medium or low).9\n Managing risk\nbegins with classifying all incidents, whether or not tangible harm actually results from them.10\n3. Treatment of the incident: A technical expert decides on the necessary measures to treat the incident\nonce the incident has been classified and the time for treatment has been agreed.\n4. Closure of the incident: All information generated during the treatment is recorded and the person\nwho first sent notification of the incident is informed that the incident is closed.\n5. Knowledge base: All information generated during the treatment of the incident is used to inform and\ntrain colleagues and as reference material for future similar incidents.\nHumanitarian organizations can base their SOPs on this 5-step model, describing how each step should\ntake place within their organization. This should include the functions/roles and teams within an\norganization that are responsible at each stage of the process. These steps should be incorporated into\nor extended from existing incident response protocols (e.g. security incident management related to\nhumanitarian access).\nIn a given response context, organizations should also work to integrate any joint incident management\nprocedures into existing coordination structures, such as the clusters and mechanisms for inter- and\nintra-cluster coordination.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 5\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT IN\nHUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS\nIntroducing or improving data incident management in humanitarian operations is critical to more\nresponsible data practice in the sector. The Centre for Humanitarian Data recommends that organizations\nfocus on the following areas:\n1. Establish a common understanding of data incident management\nUse a risk model to understand the causal chain that can lead to data incidents for specific offices and\nsystems. Identify key threat actors and vulnerabilities for offices and systems and understand existing\nsecurity controls and their effectiveness. Finally, map existing data incident management capacity\nand determine whether it is positioned appropriately. Once clear definitions and processes are\narticulated, invest in staff awareness and support a culture of open dialogue about incidents, in which\nproactive reporting and management of incidents is incentivized, not punished.\n2. Strengthen data incident management capacity\nTake measures to put in place security controls to mitigate the risk of data incidents, and share best\npractice with partners. Build on existing work in the sector to fill governance gaps which can create\nvulnerabilities for your organization. Engage with organizational partners to set up information\nchannels around data incidents. Share known vulnerabilities in a controlled manner with trusted\ncounterparts for cross-organizational learning.\n3. Support continuous learning\nSupport learning and development of improved data incident management practices by organizing\ntraining and drills based on scenarios likely to occur in different operational settings. These exercises\nshould occur regularly and may even involve multiple organizations training and drilling together. In\naddition, document actual data incidents as cases for internal knowledge development.\nOrganizations are encouraged to share their experience in the development of data incident management\nwith the Centre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.\nThis project is co-funded\nby the European Union\nThis document covers humanitarian aid activities implemented with the financial assistance of the\nEuropean Union.

Background\nThis document summarises the documentation and the nding of the peer review of the trigger\nused in OCHA’s Philippines Anticipatory Action framework for typhoons. The impact prediction\nmodel used as the basis for the trigger was developed by the Netherlands Red Cross 510 data\nand digital team, on behalf of the IFRC network and its partners. The model uses typhoon track\nand rainfall forecasts to predict the percentage of houses that will be severely damaged per\nmunicipality in the Philippines. OCHA Philippines used this model as a basis to begin a response\nbefore a typhoon hit, based on the predicted number of houses damaged in the regions of Bicol\nand Eastern Visayas. To nd out more about this application, please see the Anticipatory Action\nFramework for the Philippines.\nThis peer review was conducted between September 2021 and July 2022.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nThe documentation regarding the model, its application and the review process can be found at\nthe following links:\n● The Model Card describes version 1.0 of the model and was completed in September\n2021.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix was completed in October 2021 by a technical expert from\nLeiden University, and in February 2022 by the client.\n● The Implementation Plan was completed in October 2021. It summarises the concrete\nactions that the model will trigger or inform as part of the 2021-2022 OCHA anticipatory\naction framework in the Philippines\n● The Ethical Matrix aims to identify all stakeholders and potential issues regarding the\nintended use of the model. It was completed in November 2021 by an expert from the\nLondon School of Economics; and updated in July 2022.\nA summary of the main ndings and recommendations is provided below.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The target of the model is P (#damaged houses > threshold t). Several combinations of\nProbability P and threshold t are used as a trigger for early action. Make a clear\nstatement under which circumstance which combination is used. This will help with later\nevaluation of the model and transparency of its use.\nModel Development\n● As mentioned in the ethical review, more information about the sources of the input data\nis desirable. The model should include information on how often the data sets are\nupdated, and how often the model is retrained to reect these updates.\nModel Evaluation\n● The model is compared against a damage curve that is currently used to estimate\ndamage. Adjust this benchmark to whichever model or algorithm is used by the\nPhilippine authorities to estimate damage.\n● Specify how much variance in model performance is acceptable, i.e., with the model\nworking on average better than the benchmark, how much extreme over /\nunderestimation is acceptable for eld use. More specically, indicate how robust the\nmodel performance is over different typhoons.\nOperational Readiness\n● For every model version, make a model release and keep an updated list of associated\ninput data. This will make reproducibility of earlier results easier and help keep track of\nthe data sources (and whose responsibility those are).\n2.2 Ethical Review\nInaccuracy\nThe model performance scores for 2021 Typhoon Surigae are not reported. The rationale for\nusing the given error / accuracy tool and not others is missing. The model does not perform well\nat predicting really low and really high damage.\n● Recommendation: (1) Report latest error scores; (2) Contextualise the quality of the error\nscores in light of existing and relevant research; (3) Include the rationale for using a\nparticular method of calculating error score as opposed to others.\nFalse Negatives\nIn the case of Typhoon Goni in 2020, the model did not predict an extreme event until only a few\nhours before landfall.\n● Recommendation: If the model does have 100% weightage in the activation of the\ntrigger, then the possibility of a false negative should be clear operationally, e.g., in the\ncase of Typhoon Goni. This is of particular importance because we know that the model\ndoes perform well in cases of rapid intensication or high damage scenarios.\nMissing Attributes\nThe implementation model mentions a priority list based on poverty, gender, and building material,\nwhile the model uses poverty, hazard data, and building type where poverty is not disaggregated\nunless it follows some national standard of income levels to estimate poverty lines.\n● Recommendation: Clarity is required on the relative importance of variables used, and\nconsistency between the model and the implementation plan. There needs to be a\ndistinction drawn between the model and how the outputs of the model are used. Clear\ndelineation between input data (inclusion / exclusion criteria etc.); modelling process,\noutput, and use; and validation / verication, with a clear trail of documentation.\nLead Times\nLead time is the length of time between when a forecast is output and the occurrence of the\nshock that was forecasted. It is unclear the impact that forecast running time has on lead times\nfor implementation. In the case of Typhoon Ursula (Phanfone) in 2019, the trigger was reached\nonly 12 hours prior to landfall for which no humanitarian action could be planned.\n● Recommendation: In the implementation plan, more clarity is required on potential\noperational impact of long lead times, especially with 100% weightage of model output\nfor trigger activation. The effect of different lead times is unclear for the implementation.\nTo quote one of the documents: 'It takes several hours for the forecast to run so the\ninitial conditions are already often outdated'.\nDecision Support\nDecision support concerns the extent to which action based on model output.\n● Recommendation: Clarity is required in the implementation plan about weightage of\nmodel output on trigger activation, i.e., how much of the decision to act depends on the\nmodel output. If this is not 100%, then the other considerations should be described.\n● Recommendation: Given the possibility of a false negative, operational readiness in case\nof model failure should be detailed in the implementation plan.\nStatistical Bias\nStatistical bias occurs when a model or statistic is not representative of the underlying\npopulation. In this model, different input datasets are used to model different typhoon scenarios,\nsocial vulnerability / poverty data is not suciently disaggregated for evaluation, and the relative\nimportance / weightage of the variables in the model is unclear.\n● Recommendation: The model requires clear documentation of the different datasets\nused, particularly the rationale behind parameters used and their disaggregation, e.g.,\npoverty index. Discrepancies on this front exist between the model card and\nimplementation plan, and the model would benet from their harmonisation. It would\nalso be useful to include these in an overview of the model development process, i.e., the\nrelative weighting and importance of these variables, and how the model changes when\nthey change.\nLack of Transparency\nThe model is open source and has undergone technical review but is missing some\ndocumentation.\n● Recommendation: The model would benet from better documentation of the modelling\nprocess, rationale for the algorithm selection, its tness for purpose, inclusion/ exclusion\ncriteria for variables, etc.\nSystemic Bias\nSystemic bias is the inherent tendency of a process to support specic outcomes. In this mode,\nsocial vulnerability and poverty data are not substantially disaggregated. The move from 'common\ndataset' to 'composite dataset' involved ranking of variables.\n● Recommendation: Clarity, rationale and disaggregation of parameters like social\nvulnerability and poverty would be benecial. Clarity required in relative weights of\nvariables when ranking."

Despite the overall reduction, reported global cases rose throughout June driven by increases in the\nEastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and the Americas. The Omicron variant continues to comprise\nthe majority (94 percent) of sequenced cases, including the Omicron sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5 which appear\nmore capable of evading immunity from vaccination or past infection. Countries in the Global Humanitarian\nOverview (GHO) comprised 8 and 14 percent of global cases and deaths respectively in Q2 2022, reporting 4.6\nmillion cases and 23,000 deaths.\n• WHO data reveals between 597,000 to 2.2 million excess deaths attributable to COVID-19 occurred in countries\nwith humanitarian response plans (HRP) between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021, significantly more\ndeaths from COVID-19 than officially reported. This data highlights the steep toll of the pandemic across\nhumanitarian settings.\n• Total vaccine doses delivered to HRP countries fell by half in Q2 2022 compared to Q1 2022. Eight HRP\ncountries received no doses this quarter, including Burundi, CAR, El Salvador, Libya, Niger, Ukraine, Venezuela,\nand Yemen. Of these, Burundi, Niger, and Yemen are yet to vaccinate more than 5 percent of populations.\nCOVAX was the largest supplier of doses to HRP countries in May and June.\n• Projected economic growth declined further in 17 HRP countries from January to June 2022 due to the\ncompounding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the secondary impacts of the war in Ukraine. Expected\nGDP growth in 2023 has been reduced by a percentage point or more for 8 HRP countries, with Mozambique\n(-3.6), Sudan (-3), and Niger (-2.3) facing the steepest reductions in expected growth. Humanitarian settings\nalso face significant debt risks, with four HRP countries – Chad, Mozambique, Somalia, and Sudan – currently\nin debt distress.\n• Fourteen immunization campaigns continue to be postponed due to COVID-19 in Q2 2022, impacting more than\n52 million people across 13 GHO countries. The postponement of these campaigns, targeting diseases like\nyellow fever, measles, cholera, and polio, increase the risk of secondary diseases spreading across\nhumanitarian settings, with outbreaks of diseases like measles occurring in Q2 2022.\n• New data from UN Women reveals that 26 HRP countries had gender sensitive pandemic policies, with seven\ngender sensitive policies implemented on average. Colombia implemented the most (31), followed by 1\nHonduras (17) and oPt (16). Iraq and Libya had none.

Epidemiological Update\nGlobal reported COVID-19 cases in the Second Quarter 2022 (Q2 2022) declined by 71 percent, falling from 196 million\nto 57 million. This decline, however, likely reflects reduced testing and monitoring meaning fewer cases are detected.\nEven with testing scaled back, and despite the overall drop during Q2, reported COVID-19 cases rose in June globally for three\nconsecutive weeks. Regional increases in the Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and the Americas drove this\nincrease. This spike in reported COVID-19 may signal a larger increase in COVID-19 transmission cases beyond that reflected 2\nin reported figures, given lower rates of testing. The weekly rate of deaths remained stable globally, although increases in\ndeaths typically lag cases and thus could rise in coming weeks.\nThe Omicron variant comprises most COVID-19 cases (94 percent), with Omicron sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5\nincreasingly represented within sequenced samples. These two sub-variants appear more capable of evading immunity\nfrom vaccination or past infection. BA.4 and BA.5 were classified as Variants of Concern by the European Centre for Disease\nProtection in May 2022, and they are currently driving surges in COVID-19 cases in countries like the USA. 3\nCountries in the Global Humanitarian Overview (GHO) comprised 8 percent and 14 percent of global cases and deaths\nrespectively in Q2 2022, reporting 4.6 million deaths and 23,000 deaths. Of these 282,000 cases and 2,670 deaths\noccurred in countries with Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs). Across HRPs, Burundi (11 percent) and Guatemala (9\npercent) reported the largest increases in cases this quarter, while Guatemala (7 percent) and DRC (3 percent) reported the\nlargest increase in deaths. Humanitarian settings continue to face significant barriers to testing and surveillance, meaning\nmany COVID-19 cases and deaths may go unreported.\nFigure 1 & 2.

COVID-19 deaths in Q2 in GHO and HRP countries\n(as of 30 June 2022)\nThe pandemic exacted a greater toll on humanitarian settings than officially reported, with 597,000 to 2.2 million\nexcess deaths attributable to COVID-19 occurring across HRP countries according to WHO data. This is significantly more\nthan reported in official figures. Low rates of testing and surveillance masked initial reporting, but new data from WHO and\nother sources identify additional excess deaths likely attributable to COVID-19 occurring between 1 January 2020 and 31\nDecember 2021.4\nFurthermore, newly released data collected across 25 low- and middle-income countries finds that the risk of dying from\nCOVID-19 was twice as high in lower-income countries compared to high-income ones. This is likely due to low-income 5\ncountries having less access to vaccinations, weaker health care systems, more multigenerational households, and less ability\nto work from home. HRP countries included in this study are Colombia, Ethiopia, and Mozambique.\nFigure 5.

Low vaccination leaves humanitarian settings vulnerable to\nfuture surges and new variants. Even in settings where doses have been delivered, there remain barriers to administration\nincluding weak healthcare systems, vaccine hesitancy, compounding crises, and transport issues. Yemen, Somalia, Syria,\nChad, South Sudan, DRC, and Burundi are yet to administer more than one-third of delivered doses.\nSince the end of Q1, the overall vaccination rate across the AMC92 – the 92 lower-income countries eligible for\nfinancing support through COVAX to access vaccines – has increased from 40 percent to 47 percent, whereas the\naverage vaccination rate in the 34 countries for concerted support has increased from 7 to 10 percent. The COVID-19\nVaccine Delivery Partnership has been supporting the AMC92 countries since January 2022 in accelerating vaccine delivery\nwith a focus on the 34 countries at or below 10 percent vaccination coverage in January 2022. At the end of Q1, 19 countries\nwere at or below 10 percent coverage which has dropped slightly to 18 countries by the end of Q2. Of those 18 countries, 14\nface ongoing humanitarian emergencies, highlighting the challenges and complexities associated with vaccine delivery in a\ncontext of fragile health systems, competing health and humanitarian priorities, and significant logistical challenges. These\ncountries continue to exhibit low or flatlining vaccination rates, highlighting the need for more tailored approaches, including\ncloser engagement with humanitarian partners on the ground to support vaccine delivery.\nFigure 8. Population coverage by delivery and admin by HRP country\n(as of 30 June 2022)\nMore than 868 million in combined vaccine financing was approved by the World Bank (850 million) and GAVI’s Country\nDelivery Support (18.5 million) in Q2 2022, reaching eight GHO countries. This is a significant increase from total vaccine\nfinancing approved in Q1 2022, during which 257.8 million was approved for eight GHO countries. Türkiye received the most\n(500 million) followed by Ethiopia (195 million) and Costa Rica (120 million).

Secondary Impacts\nEconomic Effects\nProjected economic growth declined further in 17 HRP countries from January to June 2022, with the compounding\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the secondary impacts of the war in Ukraine globally setting back GDP growth,\nrecovery of incomes to pre-pandemic levels, and poverty reduction. The pandemic lef the world more vulnerable to the 6\nsecondary economic shocks now stemming from the war in Ukraine, including rising food and fuel prices and inflation. As of\nJune 2022, global growth is expected to fall from 5.7 percent in 2021 to 2.9 percent in 2022, a growth rate 1.2 percent lower\nthan that predicted in January 2022. Global growth will likely be dampened through 2024 due to the lingering effects of the\npandemic and disruptions from the war. The World Bank predicts several years of above-average inflation and below-average\ngrowth. In 40 percent of developing economies, real income per capita will remain below pre-COVID-19 levels in 2023. Of the\n21 HRPs for which data is available, 17 face lower projected real GDP growth for 2022 and/or 2023 compared to growth\npredictions made in January 2022. Possible lockdowns, transport delays, or industry closures remain a downside risk to\nglobal economies.\n World Bank, ‘Global Economic Prospects,’ June 2022. 6\nSources: Epidemiological Update (World Health Organization, Our World in Data, Media sources); Vaccine update (Gavi, Our World in Data, UNICEF, WHO, World Bank, Media\nsources); Secondary Impacts (UNESCO, OCHA, IMF, World Bank, Media sources); Funding Update (OCHA) as of 1 July 2022.

Growth projections in June 2023 for HRPs, revised from January 2022\n(as of 30 June 2022)\nExpected GDP growth in 2023 has been reduced by a percentage point or more for 8 HRP countries, with Mozambique\n(-3.6), Sudan (-3), and Niger (-2.3) facing the steepest reductions in expected growth. Compounding crises – including\nclimate change, ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict and unrest, rising food and fuel prices, and food insecurity\nall contribute to lower economic growth in these settings. Future COVID-19 surges or new variants could further undermine\neconomic growth by increasing uncertainty and causing shipping delays. HRP countries are particularly vulnerable due to low\nrates of vaccination, limited access to therapeutics, and weakened healthcare systems. Projected 2022 GDP growth increased\nin six HRP countries, however, including Iraq and Nigeria, in part because they are oil exporting economies and thus benefit\nfrom rising commodity prices in recent months.\nHumanitarian settings also face significant debt risks, with four HRP countries – Chad, Mozambique, Somalia, and\nSudan – currently in debt distress. An additional seven are at high risk of debt distress. Debt servicing payments were\npaused during the COVID-19 pandemic, resuming in 2022 right as interest rates began to increase. This makes debt more\nexpensive and less sustainable for humanitarian settings. Wealthy countries pledged in 2021 to reallocate USD 100 billion in\nSpecial Drawing Rights to lower-income countries. At present, there are pledges to reallocate USD 60 billion. 7\nRoutine Immunization & Health\nFourteen immunization campaigns continue to be postponed due to COVID-19 in Q2 2022, impacting more than 52\nmillion people across 13 GHO countries. The postponement of these campaigns, targeting diseases like yellow fever,\nmeasles, cholera, and polio, increase the risk of secondary diseases spreading across humanitarian settings.\nMeasles cases, for instance, spiked by 79 percent in the first two months of 2022 compared to 2021. This is due to routine\nimmunization disruption caused by the pandemic. HRP countries, according to April 2022 data, are most impacted, with 8\n Devex, ‘Opinion: Ukraine conflict shows urgency of SDR reallocation for Africa,’ 24 May 2022.

Pakistan is currently experiencing a 9\nsurge in wild polio cases. Disruptions to routine immunization caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are another compounding 10\nfactor contributing to polio’s spread in Pakistan. In April 2020, more than 40 million children across Pakistan missed their\npolio vaccination afer the cancellation of an immunization campaign, with subsequent disruptions persisting throughout the\npandemic. National healthcare systems must continue to be strengthened, both to manage COVID-19 long-term and to 11\nabsorb increased cases of secondary diseases due to pandemic related disruptions of routine immunization.\nGender Update\nNew data from UN women reveals that 26 HRP countries had gender sensitive pandemic policies, with seven gender\nsensitive policies implemented on average. The refers to policies adopted at the national level that directly address 12\nchallenges which uniquely or disproportionately affect women and girls, including violence against women and girls (96\npolicies), women’s economic security (94 policies), or unpaid care work (3 policies). For instance, a policy addressing women’s\neconomic security may target women to receive household cash transfers or prioritize for benefits a subset of workers in\nwhich women are significantly overrepresented. Colombia implemented the most gender sensitive policies (31), followed by\nHonduras (17) and oPt (16). Iraq and Libya had none. Only three countries – Burundi, oPt, and Ukraine – implemented policies\ndirectly supporting unpaid care. Women took on a greater burden of unpaid caregiving, including caring for sick relatives\nduring the pandemic. Failing to support this labor disadvantages women and undermines their empowerment.\nFigure 11.

The pandemic eroded progress on gender-based violence,\neconomic empowerment, education, and healthcare. COVID-19 and its secondary effects lef women and girls in a worse\nposition than before the pandemic and increased vulnerability to compounding crises, such as food insecurity or conflict. The\npandemic set back progress on domestic violence, with the percent of respondents who believe there are acceptable\ncircumstances to hit a partner increasing by 2 percentage points to 19 percent, according to a 20-country survey. Women’s 13\neconomic security also remains at risk. Globally, women’s poverty continues to increase, with more women in poverty than\nmen. Over 11 million girls remain at risk of not returning to school, reducing their employment and earning opportunities 14\nand increasing the risk of early marriage and pregnancy. Many women and girls also lost access to reproductive care as 15\nhealthcare systems were strained by COVID-19, contributing to maternal mortality, unwanted pregnancies, disease, and\nschool dropouts. Global estimates suggest that the pandemic caused a 37 percent increase in maternal deaths. Across Latin 16\nAmerica and the Caribbean, 1 in 4 girls did not have access to family planning services. As data remains limited, the full 17\nrepercussions of the pandemic on women and girls may not be known for years to come.\n4. Funding Update\nAt the end of Q2 2022, 22 percent of total humanitarian financing needs (46.35 billion total GHO) are met. Thirteen HRP\ncountries have received more than 20 percent of funding, Libya (45.7 percent), Central African Republic (38.7 percent), and\nAfghanistan (34.4 percent). The Ukraine flash appeal, which supersedes the HRP, has received 78.2 percent of required\nfunding.

Background\nThis document summarises the documentation and the nding of the peer review of the trigger\nused in OCHA’s Philippines Anticipatory Action framework for typhoons. The impact prediction\nmodel used as the basis for the trigger was developed by the Netherlands Red Cross 510 data\nand digital team, on behalf of the IFRC network and its partners. The model uses typhoon track\nand rainfall forecasts to predict the percentage of houses that will be severely damaged per\nmunicipality in the Philippines. OCHA Philippines used this model as a basis to begin a response\nbefore a typhoon hit, based on the predicted number of houses damaged in the regions of Bicol\nand Eastern Visayas. To nd out more about this application, please see the Anticipatory Action\nFramework for the Philippines.\nThis peer review was conducted between September 2021 and July 2022.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nThe documentation regarding the model, its application and the review process can be found at\nthe following links:\n● The Model Card describes version 1.0 of the model and was completed in September\n2021.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix was completed in October 2021 by a technical expert from\nLeiden University, and in February 2022 by the client.\n● The Implementation Plan was completed in October 2021. It summarises the concrete\nactions that the model will trigger or inform as part of the 2021-2022 OCHA anticipatory\naction framework in the Philippines\n● The Ethical Matrix aims to identify all stakeholders and potential issues regarding the\nintended use of the model. It was completed in November 2021 by an expert from the\nLondon School of Economics; and updated in July 2022.\nA summary of the main ndings and recommendations is provided below.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The target of the model is P (#damaged houses > threshold t). Several combinations of\nProbability P and threshold t are used as a trigger for early action. Make a clear\nstatement under which circumstance which combination is used. This will help with later\nevaluation of the model and transparency of its use.\nModel Development\n● As mentioned in the ethical review, more information about the sources of the input data\nis desirable. The model should include information on how often the data sets are\nupdated, and how often the model is retrained to reect these updates.\nModel Evaluation\n● The model is compared against a damage curve that is currently used to estimate\ndamage. Adjust this benchmark to whichever model or algorithm is used by the\nPhilippine authorities to estimate damage.\n● Specify how much variance in model performance is acceptable, i.e., with the model\nworking on average better than the benchmark, how much extreme over /\nunderestimation is acceptable for eld use. More specically, indicate how robust the\nmodel performance is over different typhoons.\nOperational Readiness\n● For every model version, make a model release and keep an updated list of associated\ninput data. This will make reproducibility of earlier results easier and help keep track of\nthe data sources (and whose responsibility those are).\n2.2 Ethical Review\nInaccuracy\nThe model performance scores for 2021 Typhoon Surigae are not reported. The rationale for\nusing the given error / accuracy tool and not others is missing. The model does not perform well\nat predicting really low and really high damage.\n● Recommendation: (1) Report latest error scores; (2) Contextualise the quality of the error\nscores in light of existing and relevant research; (3) Include the rationale for using a\nparticular method of calculating error score as opposed to others.\nFalse Negatives\nIn the case of Typhoon Goni in 2020, the model did not predict an extreme event until only a few\nhours before landfall.\n● Recommendation: If the model does have 100% weightage in the activation of the\ntrigger, then the possibility of a false negative should be clear operationally, e.g., in the\ncase of Typhoon Goni. This is of particular importance because we know that the model\ndoes perform well in cases of rapid intensication or high damage scenarios.\nMissing Attributes\nThe implementation model mentions a priority list based on poverty, gender, and building material,\nwhile the model uses poverty, hazard data, and building type where poverty is not disaggregated\nunless it follows some national standard of income levels to estimate poverty lines.\n● Recommendation: Clarity is required on the relative importance of variables used, and\nconsistency between the model and the implementation plan. There needs to be a\ndistinction drawn between the model and how the outputs of the model are used. Clear\ndelineation between input data (inclusion / exclusion criteria etc.); modelling process,\noutput, and use; and validation / verication, with a clear trail of documentation.\nLead Times\nLead time is the length of time between when a forecast is output and the occurrence of the\nshock that was forecasted. It is unclear the impact that forecast running time has on lead times\nfor implementation. In the case of Typhoon Ursula (Phanfone) in 2019, the trigger was reached\nonly 12 hours prior to landfall for which no humanitarian action could be planned.\n● Recommendation: In the implementation plan, more clarity is required on potential\noperational impact of long lead times, especially with 100% weightage of model output\nfor trigger activation. The effect of different lead times is unclear for the implementation.\nTo quote one of the documents: 'It takes several hours for the forecast to run so the\ninitial conditions are already often outdated'.\nDecision Support\nDecision support concerns the extent to which action based on model output.\n● Recommendation: Clarity is required in the implementation plan about weightage of\nmodel output on trigger activation, i.e., how much of the decision to act depends on the\nmodel output. If this is not 100%, then the other considerations should be described.\n● Recommendation: Given the possibility of a false negative, operational readiness in case\nof model failure should be detailed in the implementation plan.\nStatistical Bias\nStatistical bias occurs when a model or statistic is not representative of the underlying\npopulation. In this model, different input datasets are used to model different typhoon scenarios,\nsocial vulnerability / poverty data is not suciently disaggregated for evaluation, and the relative\nimportance / weightage of the variables in the model is unclear.\n● Recommendation: The model requires clear documentation of the different datasets\nused, particularly the rationale behind parameters used and their disaggregation, e.g.,\npoverty index. Discrepancies on this front exist between the model card and\nimplementation plan, and the model would benet from their harmonisation. It would\nalso be useful to include these in an overview of the model development process, i.e., the\nrelative weighting and importance of these variables, and how the model changes when\nthey change.\nLack of Transparency\nThe model is open source and has undergone technical review but is missing some\ndocumentation.\n● Recommendation: The model would benet from better documentation of the modelling\nprocess, rationale for the algorithm selection, its tness for purpose, inclusion/ exclusion\ncriteria for variables, etc.\nSystemic Bias\nSystemic bias is the inherent tendency of a process to support specic outcomes. In this mode,\nsocial vulnerability and poverty data are not substantially disaggregated. The move from 'common\ndataset' to 'composite dataset' involved ranking of variables.\n● Recommendation: Clarity, rationale and disaggregation of parameters like social\nvulnerability and poverty would be benecial. Clarity required in relative weights of\nvariables when ranking."

Background\nThis report summarises the documentation and ndings of the peer review of the trigger used in\nUN OCHA’s Burkina Faso Anticipatory Action framework for drought. The impact prediction\nmodel used as a basis for this trigger was developed by the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data\nPredictive Analytics team. The go-no-go trigger mechanism is based on the IRI seasonal rainfall\nforecast, with a threshold dependent on geographical coverage and below-average rainfall\nprobability. To nd out more, please see the Anticipatory Action Framework for Burkina Faso.\nThe review has been conducted between May and December 2022.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nYou can nd all the documentation regarding the model, its application and the review process\nat the following links:\n● The Model Card describes version 1.0 of the model and was completed in May 2022.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix was completed in July 2022 by a technical expert from the\nRed Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n● The Implementation Plan was completed in October 2022.

The Ethical Matrix was completed by an expert from DFID in\nNovember 2022.\nA summary of the main ndings and recommendations is provided below.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The model is simple and scalable; however, an alternative source of forecast should be\nused for verication, and other drought indicators such as dry spells considered.\n● Clarication is required on the mismatch between drought return periods, and how\ngeographical targeting is performed given the coarse resolution.\nModel Development and Documentation\n● Additional verication metrics are required to increase the condence of the trigger, in\nparticular due to the limited hindcast.\n● More clarity is needed on how the minimum required area of below average precipitation\nof 10% was chosen, and the exact thresholds used across lead times and activation\nwindows should be specied.\nModel Evaluation\n● The model uncertainty was clearly communicated and accepted by stakeholders.\n● A strategy to increase model trust is lacking. For example, the methodology could be\nsubmitted to a peer-review / academic journal for review once it is more mature.\n● Discussion on potential negative risks due to interventions occurring in a\nconict-affected country is very much needed.\nOperational Readiness\n● The model was developed collaboratively and is ready to be piloted.\n● The choice of forecasting information and baseline for verication should be\nre-examined to improve trust in the trigger system.\n● More reection on the potential negative effects of a false alarm is required.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nEffectiveness: Regional Selection\nThe motivation behind the selection of targeted regions is unclear, and in particular, is missing Est,\nwhich has been identied as high-risk across several factors, including food insecurity.\n● Recommendation: Expand the explanation on the selection of the four regions, in\nparticular why Est was not included and Boucle de Mouhoun was.\nEffectiveness: Focus on Drought\nThe cause of food insecurity in Burkina Faso is linked with several factors in addition to drought,\nincluding conict, agricultural practice, supply chain disruptions and food prices.\n● Recommendation: Better justify the selection of rainfall as the sole trigger and why other\nfactors were not included.\nEffectiveness: Sub-regional Targeting\nIt is unclear if and how sub-districts with projected IPC-5 will be targeted.\n● Recommendation: Include more details on how districts and communities most in need\nwill be targeted by the UN agencies implementing the interventions.\nEciency and Feasibility: Best Use of Resources\nWith the Burkina Faso HRP being severely underfunded, it is unclear whether this anticipatory\naction pilot diverts funding away from more urgent needs identied by the Food Security Cluster.\n● Recommendation: Discuss the potential impacts that $15 million could have on the\nregion or globally and compare to the impacts of the no-regrets approach.\nEciency and Feasibility: Maximise Collective Action and Avoid Duplication\nThe rationale for the choice of model, and how it helps leverage common resources and avoid\nduplication, is lacking.\n● Recommendation: Expand the framework to discuss how the model complements\nexisting early warning and food insecurity mitigation efforts in Burkina Faso, such as\nFEWS NET and CH/IPC.\nEciency and feasibility: Risk/harm-benet Analysis\nA risk/harm-benet analysis is required to understand ethical and nancial risks and is missing\nfrom the framework.\n● Recommendation: Perform a full risk/harm-benet analysis.\nAccountability and Community Participation\nThe implementation plan makes little reference to affected communities, local organizations and\nauthorities in the design of the framework.\n● Recommendation: The framework should include activities to engage and explain the\nmodel to local civil society, affected populations and authorities.\n● Recommendation: Explain why there were no partnerships formed with ECOWAS,\nUEMOA and the RCPA.\nNeutrality, Impartiality and Conict-sensitivity\nIt is unclear how much the framework takes into account the presence of conict in the region.\n● Recommendation: Investigate the feasibility of carrying out a detailed conict sensitivity\nassessment.\nTrustworthiness and Reliability\nOutstanding questions remain on choice of forecast, and whether other options were considered.\n● Recommendation: Expand the explanation of why the IRI dataset was the only one used.\nTransparency and Explainability\nNo information on how an external actor can learn how the model works and understand the basis\nof the trigger decisions.\n● Recommendation: Amend the framework to include activities that engage and explain\nthe model to local civil society, affected populations and authorities.\nHuman in the Loop\nNo human stop mechanism specied per the recommendation of the Ethiopia evaluation.\n● Recommendation: Investigate the possibility of including a stop mechanism.\nFeedback\nThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic, research and\nprivate sector to engage with us on the peer review process.

Louise M. Slaughter (D-NY-28), Ranking Member of the House Rules\nCommittee, today repeated her call for a cost-benefit analysis of the Department of Homeland\nSecurity's Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) following the release of a new study\nfrom the BESTT Coalition (Borders for Economic Security, Trade and Tourism). The study\nconcluded that the United States stands to lose $785 million annually if the WHTI is\nimplemented in its current form.\n\n  \n\n &quot;This new study is only more evidence that the Travel Initiative is deeply flawed\nand needs to be changed,&quot; Rep. Slaughter said. &quot;If we don't conduct a\ncomprehensive economic analysis of this plan before ground is broken, we will simply\nbe writing off the economic security of millions of Americans and Canadians. And they\ndeserve better.&quot;\n\n  \n\n Rep. Slaughter was today joined by 20 New York Members of Congress in requesting that the\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) oversee the proposed analysis. She had previously\nemployed an Executive Order in a further attempt to force the federal government to study the\neconomic impact of its plan.\n\n  \n\n The Conference Board of Canada confirmed BESTT's findings. It concluded that the WHTI\nwould result in 3.5 million fewer nationwide crossings from Canada to the United States, and\n 1 / 2\nMarch 13, 2006 - New Study Reveals U.S. to Lose $785 Million, Canada $1.7 Billion Annually with WHTI\nmore than twice this number from the U.S. to Canada. In addition to the $785 million annually\nlost by America, the Canadian economy would stand to lose $1.7 billion per year in revenue.\n\n  \n\n The BESTT study used a Zogby International poll taken of individuals living in cities along the\nborder. The poll found that such citizens would be less likely to visit the United States if they\nwere required to use a passport or another secure document at the border, a requirement of the\nWHTI. The study also revealed that:\n\n  \n\n - Vacation is the top reason why Americans and Canadians travel to Canada and the\nUnited States, respectively. Many poll respondents also said that they would not participate in a\nprogram requiring a new identification card for cross-border travel.\n - Most Canadian visitors to the United States travel more than 100 miles to get there. They\nare also two times as likely as American tourists to spend over $500 during their visit.\nConsequently, their trips contribute significantly not just to border economies, but to a broader\narray of communities in both countries.\n - A majority of the poll's respondents said that they supported an enhanced driver's license\nthat could combine a normal license with a border crossing ID card, and that such a document\nwould increase the likelihood that they would continue to cross the border.\n - Most poll respondents also said that they did not believe that new border-crossing\nrestrictions were necessary.\n\n 2 / 2"

Background\nThis document summarizes the documentation and ndings developed in the peer review of the\nAnticipatory Action Trigger for Drought in Niger. The trigger mechanism was designed for an\nanticipatory action framework coordinated by OCHA. The goal of the trigger mechanism is to\ndetect increased drought risk in Niger and trigger the release of funds from the Central\nEmergency Response Fund in anticipation of drought-related humanitarian needs. The release\nof funds can be triggered from six months ahead of the rainy season (which runs from July\nthrough September) until one month into the season. The trigger mechanism includes a\npredictive model that uses seasonal precipitation forecasts and an observational model that\nuses the Standardized Precipitation Index.\nThe review was conducted between May 2022 and January 2023.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nThe documentation describing the model and its application, as well as the outcomes of the\nreview process, are available through the following links:\n● The Model Card describes version 1 of the trigger mechanism. It was completed by\nOCHA in June 2022 and updated in October 2022.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix presents the outcomes of the technical review and was\ncompleted by Mohammad Shamsudduha, Associate Professor in Humanitarian Science\nat the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London, in December\n2022.\n● The Implementation Plan summarizes the concrete actions that the trigger mechanism\nwill inform and was developed by OCHA in October 2022.\n● The Ethical Matrix identies issues that may come up in the implementation of the\ntrigger mechanism and stakeholders that may be impacted by those issues. The Ethical\nMatrix was completed in January 2023 by Andrea Romaoli Garcia, ITU Topic Driver on\nOpen Code.\nThe sections below provide a summary of the main ndings and recommendations developed in\nthe review.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The intended use of the predictive model is appropriate.\n● The model may not detect localized rainfall shortages, which could lead to the model\nmissing a trigger where it should detect increased drought risk. In addition, crop failure\ndepends on a number of factors other than rainfall, including the use and availability of\ngroundwater for irrigation as well as changes in temperature. The fact that these\nadditional factors are not included in the model should be considered in the\ninterpretation of model outputs.\nModel Development and Documentation\n● The resolution of the spatial coverage of the predictive model is very high at 0.05\ndegrees. The predictive model produces outputs on a monthly basis. The geographic\nscope of the predictive model includes the entire country of Niger. These parameters are\nappropriate for a national-scale model.\n● The spatial resolution of the predictive model at 0.05 degrees is too high given that the\npredictive model is primarily dependent on precipitation variability. Correlation between\nforecasts and observational rainfall data produced by CHIRPS is weak in Maradi and\nNiamey regions, where the irrigation is the highest in the country.\nModel Evaluation\n● The predictive model is evaluated using accuracy, hit rate, miss rate, false positives and\nfalse negatives as parameters. These model evaluation criteria are appropriate for this\npredictive model.\n● A comparison between the predictive model outputs and NextGen forecasts was based\nonly on CHIRPS gridded rainfall data. No detailed information is provided on the\ndownscaling of the forecasts and evaluation of the downscaled technique.\nOperational Readiness\n● Activities and funding are provided on a “no-regrets” basis after a trigger activation.\nActivities and funding are purposefully selected to still be valuable in the absence of a\nshock. The addition of an observational trigger based on SPI is a strength of this\nanticipatory trigger mechanism.\n● The forecast accuracy could be improved if the predictive model is tailored to individual\nareas within Niger.\n● There is little mention of local/national capacity building or strengthening in the process.\n● The performance of the predictive model should be evaluated against the observational\nmodel outputs to better understand the weaknesses in the predictive model.\nStrengthening the predictive model outputs increases the potential impact of the trigger\nmechanism due to the increased lead time.\n● The low or even negative correlation between the predictive model outputs and CHIRPS\nprecipitation in the northern part of Niger should be examined to improve the\nperformance and validity of the predictive model.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nFalse negative activation (non-activation in the presence of a shock)\n● A false negative would deprive the community of timely aid.\n● Recommendation: The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously evaluated\nagainst the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS precipitation data to\nlower the likelihood of false negatives.\nFalse positive activation (activation in the absence of a shock)\n● A false positive would increase the risk of wasted nancial resources. Such error could\nundermine the condence of stakeholders and donors and could lead to discontinuation\nof the trigger mechanism. A false negative primarily impacts other stakeholders,\nincluding local NGOs, the model developers and UN entities, due to the misallocation of\nresources. It also undermines trust in the trigger mechanism.\n● Recommendation: A false positive is more tolerable compared to a false negative, as a\nfalse positive triggers activities and funding that benet the population even in the\nabsence of a shock. The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously\nevaluated against the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS\nprecipitation data to lower the likelihood of false positives.\nIdentity exposure (exposure of individual identities through potential use of additional data\nsources in implementation of the model)\n● Unauthorized access to any personal data used in future implementation of the trigger\nmechanism could cause harm and carries reputational risk.\n● Recommendation: Given that the trigger mechanism does not include the use of any\npersonal data there is little concern that a data breach could result in re-identication. If\nthe implementation of the trigger mechanism evolves over time to include additional\npersonal data, the tools and infrastructure used in implementation should be\nre-evaluated and adjusted as needed to mitigate the risk of identity exposure.\nBias in available data\n● Bias in data availability resulting from gaps in data for different regions in Niger could\naffect the allocation of funding and activities.\n● Recommendation: Determine whether there are gaps resulting in biases in climate data\navailability for Niger in order to prevent unfair allocation of funding and activities.\nFeedback\nThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic, research and\nprivate sector to engage with us on the peer review process.

The UN OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data worked with a wide range\nof technical partners to develop a methodology that was then endorsed by the Somalia ICCG\nand HCT.\nDaily FloodScan (1998-2022) & WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) raster data was analysed to gain\nunderstanding of ood conditions across Somalia for both March-April-May (MAM) and\nOctober-November-December (OND) seasons. FloodScan daily ood fraction Standard Flood\nExposure Depiction (SFED) was aggregated to yearly seasonal maximum fraction composites\nfor both the MAM and OND seasons for all years of historical FloodScan data (1998-2022).\nThe yearly seasonal SFED composites were then processed/reclassied in two distinct ways:\n1. Composites reclassied to binary using a 20 percent ood fraction threshold.\n2. Composites masked to just remove any ood fraction values < 0.05 percent and the\nood fraction (0-100 percent) retained.\nAll composites in both sets of processed yearly-seasonal ood fraction rasters were then\nmultiplied by the WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) population estimate raster to create two sets of\nyearly seasonal ood exposure rasters. These were then aggregated at the second\nadministrative level via zonal statistics (sum) to obtain the estimated population exposure per\ndistrict for each season across all years for each set. These estimates were converted to the\npercent of population exposed by dividing the estimates by the total population per district\n(from World Pop raster). The percent exposure gure was then applied to the updated 2024\npopulation data set (UN OCHA, UNFPA Methodology) to obtain updated population exposure\nestimates. These data were further aggregated to administrative level 1.\nRanges for exposure were estimated using percentiles for both the MAM and OND seasons per\nadministrative level. As ECMWF seasonal forecast predicts an above average precipitation\nseason for MAM 2024, the range of population exposed was based on the 50th-95th percentile\nlevels. Since there was no available data to inform predictions for OND 2024, the 25-75th\npercentile values were used to bound the range. The lower and upper limits of the ranges were\nPage 1 of 2\ncalculated at the administrative level using all of the historical yearly seasonal ood exposure\nestimates. The two sets of range estimates were combined conservatively by taking the\nmaximum value for both the upper and lower bounds for each season.\nContact the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data via Leonardo Milano, Team Lead for Data\nScience at leonardo.milano@un.org with any questions or feedback.\nPage 2 of 2"

Res. Lett., 36, L19803,\ndoi:10.1029/2009GL040248.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The production of tropospheric ozone (O3), a criteria\nair pollutant and potent greenhouse gas, is a complex\nfunction of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), volatile\norganic compounds (VOC), sunlight, and trace oxidants\nsuch as the hydroxyl radical (OH). O3 production is nonlinearly dependent on NOx abundance and thus accurate\ndescription of the processes that remove NOx radicals is\ncritical for predicting the down-wind influence of anthropogenic emissions on tropospheric O3. Global modeling\nstudies suggest that nocturnal processes involving the\nreactions of the nitrate radical (NO3) and N2O5 account\nfor 50% of the globally averaged annual net NOx removal\n[Dentener and Crutzen, 1993]. However, the impact of\nnocturnal NOx removal processes on the tropospheric O3\nbudget continues to be limited by uncertainty in the reaction\nrate of N2O5 with aerosol particles.\n[3] The influence of N2O5 on the removal of atmospheric\nNOx radicals is determined by the product of the probability\nthat N2O5 will react on a particle given a collision, g(N2O5),\nand the total gas-particle collision frequency primarily set\nby the available particle surface area concentration (Sa).\nUntil recently, direct measurements of g(N2O5) have been\nrestricted to the laboratory, where simplified model particle\ntypes are probed to ascertain functional dependences. These\nstudies have shown that N2O5 removal by particles and the\nresulting products are strongly dependent on: i) liquid water\ncontent (H2O(l)) [Thornton et al., 2003], ii) particle nitrate\n(NO3\n), which inhibits N2O5 hydrolysis [Wahner et al.,\n1998], iii) the presence of additional nucleophiles in water\nstressed particles [Behnke et al., 1997], iv) organic coatings\nthat have been theorized to either suppress N2O5 accommodation or decrease water availability at the surface\n[McNeill et al., 2006; Folkers et al., 2003], and v) particle\nacidity [Mozurkewich and Calvert, 1988]. These effects\nlead to measured g(N2O5) that span three orders of magnitude (1  104 < g < 0.1) depending on the chemical and\nphysical properties of the particles employed. Consistent\nwith this large potential variability, recent analyses of NO3\nand N2O5 field measurements have inferred that g(N2O5)\ncan range from 1  103 to 0.017 and is likely dependent\non particle chemical composition [Brown et al., 2006].\n[4] In the context of atmospheric particle composition,\nthe importance of the above dependences, either individually or as a whole, remains entirely unclear. Combining our\ndirect measurements of g(N2O5) on ambient particles with\nco-located observations of particle chemical composition\nand particle Sa, gas phase precursors, and meteorological\nparameters, allows such evaluations and the elucidation of\nfactors that most likely control g(N2O5) on ambient particles.\n2. Experimental Design\n[5] The pseudo-first order rate coefficient for N2O5 loss\nto aerosol particles (khet) was measured directly using an\nentrained aerosol flow reactor coupled to a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) [Kercher et al., 2009].\nThe experimental technique is described in detail elsewhere\n[Bertram et al., 2009]. Observations of g(N2O5) were made\nat two urban sampling locations during the summer of 2008.\nBetween July 3rd and 21st, observations were made from a\n10 m tower adjacent to the NOAA Earth System Research\nLaboratory in Boulder, CO. Particle size distributions (65 nm\nto 1 mm) were measured by an ultra-high sensitivity aerosol\nspectrometer and particle composition measured by an\nAerodyne compact time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer\n[DeCarlo et al., 2006; Drewnick et al., 2005]. Coincident\nmeasurements of gas-phase precursors (e.g., O3 and NO)\nand basic meteorological parameters were also made during\nthe sampling period. Between August 6th and 16th, observations were made from a 5 m sampling mast extending\nabove an instrument sea container located at the NOAA\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L19803, doi:10.1029/2009GL040248, 2009 Click\nHere for\nFull\nArticle\n1\nDepartment of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington,\nSeattle, Washington, USA. 2\nNow at Department of Chemistry, University of California, San Diego,\nLa Jolla, California, USA. 3\nDepartment of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle,\nWashington, USA. 4\nEarth System Research Laboratory, NOAA, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n5\nCIRES, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n6\nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, NOAA, Seattle, Washington,\nUSA.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276/09/2009GL040248$05.00\nL19803 1 of 5\nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, 10 km NE of\ndowntown Seattle, WA. Particle size distributions (10 nm to\n10 mm) were measured with two differential mobility\nparticle sizing instruments and aerodynamic particle sizer.\nSub-micron particle composition was measured by an\nAerodyne quadrupole aerosol mass spectrometer [Jayne et\nal., 2000].\n[6] We interpret these results using a newly developed\nparameterization of g(N2O5) [Bertram and Thornton, 2009]\nthat is driven by observations of particle composition and\nRH, and calculations of H2O(l) as determined by the aerosol\ninorganics model (AIM Model II) [Carslaw et al., 1995].\nThis approach permits us to directly assess the dependence\nof the observed g(N2O5) on the factors outlined in section 1.\n3. Observed Dependence of g(N2O5) on Particle\nChemical Composition\n[7] In Boulder, the ambient RH was low (30 ± 15%),\nparticle loadings were rather uniform (mean Sa = 108 ± 35,\ntotal mass = 5.3 ± 1.5 mg m3\n), and particles contained high\norganic mass fractions (mean organic/sulfate mass ratio =\n6.1 ± 3.9). The median g(N2O5) observed in Boulder was\n0.003 (interquartile range of 0.9– 1.2  103\n). In contrast,\nin Seattle, the ambient RH was higher (74 ± 13%), particle\nloadings were enhanced and more variable (mean Sa = 190 ±\n115, total mass = 7.2 ± 4.1 mg m3\n), but particles had similar\nbulk particle chemical composition as in Boulder (mean\norganic/sulfate = 7.1 ± 4.8). The median g(N2O5) observed\nin Seattle was 0.009 (interquartile range of 0.26 – 2.9\n102\n), a factor of three larger than measured in Boulder.\n[8] These differences in the median g(N2O5) are grossly\nconsistent with the difference in RH between the two\nlocations leading to lower H2O(l) in Boulder relative to\nSeattle. But, RH alone is not sufficient for describing either\nthe observed variability in, or the level of suppression of\ng(N2O5) relative to that expected on aqueous solution\nparticles. For example, the strongly decreasing trend of\ng(N2O5) with the increasing mass ratio of particulate\norganic matter (POM) to sulfate (SO4\n2) observed in the\nSeattle data, and the lack of such a correlation in the\nBoulder data (Figure 1a), provide insights into the particle\ncharacteristics that exert control over g(N2O5). In what\nfollows, we investigate the dependence of g(N2O5) on\nPOM, making the reasonable assumption that the aerosol\nparticles are largely internal mixtures [Murphy et al., 2006]\n(see auxiliary material).1\n[9] In the absence of POM, g(N2O5) should be controlled\nby the RH-dependent liquid water content and the molarity\nof nucleophiles such as NO3\n and chloride (Cl) [Bertram\nand Thornton, 2009; Griffiths et al., 2009; Wahner et al.,\n1998; Behnke et al., 1997]. In both locations studied, when\nPOM/SO4\n2 was lowest, the non-refractory particle composition was mainly ammonium sulfate (AS) with trace NO3\n\nand Cl (Figure S1), and our observations of g(N2O5) are in\ngood agreement with both laboratory measurements and the\nparameterization of Bertram and Thornton [2009]. Probing\nthe response of g(N2O5) to an increasing mass fraction of\nPOM, in both Boulder and Seattle, permits us to assess the\npotential affects of POM on g(N2O5). POM has been\nsuggested to influence g(N2O5) via: i) altering H2O(l),\nwhich has been shown to influence g(N2O5) either through\na direct H2O(l) limitation [Thornton et al., 2003] or by\nchanging particle [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] [Mentel et al., 1999], and/\nor ii) the formation of organic coatings on aqueous cores\nthat inhibit the accommodation or reaction of N2O5 [Badger\net al., 2006; McNeill et al., 2006; Folkers et al., 2003].\n[10] The small g(N2O5) values and lack of correlation\nwith POM observed in Boulder indicates that the particles\nsampled were either solid (independent of POM mass\nfraction) or that increases in POM did not lead to the\nassociated increase in H2O(l) required to enhance g(N2O5).\nInterestingly, our observed g(N2O5) values are consistent\nwith that predicted by the Bertram and Thornton [2009]\nparameterization regardless of the AS phase state. Laboratory measurements of g(N2O5) are <0.005 on crystalline AS\n[Mozurkewich and Calvert, 1988], similar to the median of\n0.003 observed in Boulder. If AS crystallization was\ninhibited by the available POM [Parsons et al., 2004] and\nwe treat POM as hygroscopic (i.e. malonic acid like),\nFigure 1. (a) Observed dependence of g(N2O5) on the\nmass ratio of POM to SO4\n2 for measurements made in\nSeattle (black) and Boulder (gray). (b) Calculated dependence of the molar ratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n on the mass ratio\nof POM to SO4\n2 for measurements made in Seattle,\nassuming that POM does (circles) and does not (squares)\ncontribute to H2O(l) uptake. Data points are equal\npopulation binned medians, where the bar corresponds to\nthe interquartile range of the calculations. The shaded\nregion (in panel b) represents values of [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n]\nwhere laboratory measurements predict suppression in\ng(N2O5) due to the NO3\n effect.\n1\nAuxiliary materials are available in the HTML. doi:10.1029/\n2009GL040248.\nL19803 BERTRAM ET AL.: DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF N2O5 REACTIVITY L19803\n2 of 5\ncalculations made using the Bertram and Thornton [2009]\nparameterization show that at the low RH sampled,\n[H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] is low enough to significantly suppress\ng(N2O5) to <0.005 across the entire range of POM/SO4\n2\nobserved in Boulder. Co-located measurements of g(N2O5)\nand particle phase state [Martin et al., 2008] will clearly\nallow such distinctions to be made in the future.\n[11] The behavior of g(N2O5) observed in Seattle, at\nhigher RH, more clearly illustrates the importance of\nunderstanding POM in order to assess the factors controlling g(N2O5). The dependence of g(N2O5) on POM/SO4\n2\nwas observed during a stagnation episode in which most of\nthe POM mass growth was likely due to SOA formation as\nindicated by the fraction of POM that is measured to be\nhighly oxidized (see Figure S4). In light of the above\nexpectations, the decreasing g(N2O5) with increasing\nPOM/SO4\n2 can be hypothesized to be a result of: i) a\nrelative decrease in the particulate water mass fraction,\nfollowing increased partitioning of organics that are less\nhygroscopic than AS (i.e. DH2O(l)/DPOM \u0004 0), leading to\nboth an increased nitrate effect [Wahner et al., 1998] and a\npossible H2O(l) limitation [Thornton et al., 2003], and/or\nii) an increasing role of organic coatings that limit either\nN2O5 surface accommodation or N2O5 accessibility to\nH2O(l).\n[12] To examine these suppositions, we first calculate\n[H2O(l)] and [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] using AIM for the two\nextremes of POM hygroscopicity: i) POM does not contribute to H2O(l) uptake, and ii) POM is highly hygroscopic,\ncontributing significantly to H2O(l) (POM treated as\nmalonic acid) (Figure 1b). In both cases [H2O(l)] is sufficiently high (>20M), so as not to suppress g(N2O5) directly.\nThe molar ratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n remains nearly constant\nwhen POM is allowed to contribute to H2O(l), but decreases\nwith increasing POM/SO4\n2 when POM is prohibited from\ncontributing to H2O(l). To determine whether the calculated\nchanges in [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] are sufficient for describing the\nobserved changes in g(N2O5), we use the parameterization\nfor g(N2O5) described by Bertram and Thornton [2009].\n[13] Figure 2 depicts the parameterization-observation\ncomparison for both cases as a function of the molar ratio\nof H2O(l) to NO3\n. The strong parameterization-observation\nagreement, shown in panel A, lends support to the conclusion that POM sampled in Seattle did not contribute\nsignificantly to H2O(l). Such a notion would be generally\nconsistent with the findings of Mochida et al. [2008] and\nQuinn et al. [2005], where ambient observations revealed\ndecreases in RH-dependent particle growth factors or scattering efficiency in the presence of large organic mass\nfractions. Based on our observations alone, we cannot rule\nout the possibility that organic coatings may act to offset the\neffects of hygroscopic organics (Figure 2b). Nonetheless, it\nis clear that the presence and chemical properties of POM\nplay a decisive role in setting g(N2O5) in the troposphere.\nFurther measurements of g(N2O5) downwind of source\nregions, where POM is likely more oxidized [Zhang et\nal., 2007], and more hygroscopic [Kondo et al., 2007], and/\nor alongside co-located observations of particle hygroscopic\ngrowth will be strong tests of this hypothesis and the\napplicability of these first results to regional and global\nmodels.\n4. Implications for NOx Processing Rates\n[14] Quantifying the absolute magnitude of g(N2O5) and\nultimately the loss rate of N2O5 to particles is necessary for\nreliable model representations of NOx, OH, O3, and particle\nabundances and the couplings between them. The sensitivity of the NOx budget to g(N2O5) is a strong function of the\nNO3 and N2O5 production rates, Sa, temperature, and NO3\nreactivity. To assess the importance of g(N2O5) we examine\nthe fraction of NOx present at sunset, [NOx]sunset, that is lost\nat night as a function of g(N2O5).\nFlost ¼ ½ \u0005 NOx Sunset  ½ \u0005 NOx Sunrise\n½ \u0005 NOx Sunset\nE1\nFigure 2. Comparison of parameterized [Bertram and Thornton, 2009] and observed g(N2O5) as a function of the molar\nratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n assuming (a) that POM does not contribute to H2O(l) uptake and (b) that POM contributes to H2O(l)\nuptake. Data points are separated into equal population bins, where the bar and whiskers correspond to the median to mean\nrange and the interquartile range of the observations, respectively. The parameterized g(N2O5), derived from the observed\nparticle chemical composition and RH, is shown with black solid lines and the shaded region represents the propagated\nuncertainty in its determination. The dashed black line depicts g(N2O5) as parameterized for regions where direct\nmeasurements of g(N2O5) were not available.\nL19803 BERTRAM ET AL.: DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF N2O5 REACTIVITY L19803\n3 of 5\nThe dependence of Flost on g(N2O5) and NO3 reactivity, as\ncalculated using a time-dependent chemical box model (see\nSI) for characteristic summer and winter conditions, is\nshown in Figure 3. We chose conditions (e.g., temperature\nand NO3 reactivity) in order to bracket the range of possible\nsensitivities to g(N2O5). In our summer calculations, Flost is\nprimarily limited by the NO3 production rate and nearly\nindependent of g(N2O5) due to assuming high loadings of\nbiogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), which\nincrease NO3 reactivity, and warmer temperatures, which\nshift the N2O5-NO3 equilibrium in favor of NO3. The result\nis that at high NO3 reactivity the nocturnal loss of NOx is\nindependent of g(N2O5). During winter, BVOC emissions\nare significantly smaller, and lower temperatures shift the\nN2O5-NO3 equilibrium in favor of N2O5. As a result, Flost is\nfar more sensitive to g(N2O5) during winter than in summer.\nThese calculations illustrate the acute sensitivity of the NOx\nbudget to changes in g(N2O5) between 1  104 and 0.1\nand imply that the NOx lifetime is strongly dependent on\nNO3 reactivity at low g(N2O5).\n[15] In addition to accurate predictions of the total\nnocturnal NOx loss, models must also correctly attribute\nthat loss between the N2O5 and NO3 channels to achieve a\nrealistic sensitivity of the NOx budget to changes in VOC,\ntemperature, and particle loadings. Our modeling shows this\nbranching is sensitive to g(N2O5) for the majority of likely\nconditions. The reaction products for the two channels have\ndifferent effects on oxidant concentrations and particle mass\nloadings: the products of NO3 homogeneous reactions can\nlead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol [Ng et\nal., 2008] and the heterogeneous reaction of N2O5 can lead\nto halogen activation [Finlayson-Pitts et al., 1989] or\nincreased particulate nitrate mass [Riemer et al., 2003].\n[16] When compared to predictions of g(N2O5) made\nusing two currently implemented large-scale model parameterizations [Davis et al., 2008; Evans and Jacob, 2005],\nour directly observed reactivity values are both more\nvariable and as much as a factor of ten lower, consistent\nwith reactivity values inferred from aircraft observations of\nNO3 and N2O5 [Brown et al., 2009]. If our observations\ndescribed herein are representative of other urban/suburban\nlocations, then incorporating the observed g(N2O5) into\ncurrent models would likely lead to increases in predicted\nO3 and OH, and an increased sensitivity of NOx loss to both\nNO3 reactivity and particle loadings.\n5. Conclusions\n[17] We present an analysis of the first direct measurements of g(N2O5) on ambient aerosol particles. At the limit\nof low POM, our observations confirm RH as a primary\ncontrol and particulate nitrate as a secondary control in\nregulating g(N2O5). Observations at high RH illustrate a\nstrong dependence of g(N2O5) on particle POM/SO4\n2. Our\nrecent parameterization [Bertram and Thornton, 2009] can\nadequately capture the trend and variability in the observed\ng(N2O5) if we make the assumption that the increasing\nPOM mass fractions do not contribute significantly to\nadditional particulate water uptake at the same RH. In such\na case, the nitrate effect is sufficient to explain our results. If\nPOM does contribute to H2O(l) uptake, then our results\nsuggest an additional means of suppressing g(N2O5) that is\ncorrelated with oxidized POM such as organic coatings.\nRegardless, these results clearly indicate that regional and\nglobal modeling efforts need to consider the effects of\nparticulate organic loadings and hygroscopicity in parameterizing the rate of nocturnal NOx loss via N2O5 reactions\non particles.\n[18] Acknowledgments.

Res. Lett., 36, L19803,\ndoi:10.1029/2009GL040248.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The production of tropospheric ozone (O3), a criteria\nair pollutant and potent greenhouse gas, is a complex\nfunction of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), volatile\norganic compounds (VOC), sunlight, and trace oxidants\nsuch as the hydroxyl radical (OH). O3 production is nonlinearly dependent on NOx abundance and thus accurate\ndescription of the processes that remove NOx radicals is\ncritical for predicting the down-wind influence of anthropogenic emissions on tropospheric O3. Global modeling\nstudies suggest that nocturnal processes involving the\nreactions of the nitrate radical (NO3) and N2O5 account\nfor 50% of the globally averaged annual net NOx removal\n[Dentener and Crutzen, 1993]. However, the impact of\nnocturnal NOx removal processes on the tropospheric O3\nbudget continues to be limited by uncertainty in the reaction\nrate of N2O5 with aerosol particles.\n[3] The influence of N2O5 on the removal of atmospheric\nNOx radicals is determined by the product of the probability\nthat N2O5 will react on a particle given a collision, g(N2O5),\nand the total gas-particle collision frequency primarily set\nby the available particle surface area concentration (Sa).\nUntil recently, direct measurements of g(N2O5) have been\nrestricted to the laboratory, where simplified model particle\ntypes are probed to ascertain functional dependences. These\nstudies have shown that N2O5 removal by particles and the\nresulting products are strongly dependent on: i) liquid water\ncontent (H2O(l)) [Thornton et al., 2003], ii) particle nitrate\n(NO3\n), which inhibits N2O5 hydrolysis [Wahner et al.,\n1998], iii) the presence of additional nucleophiles in water\nstressed particles [Behnke et al., 1997], iv) organic coatings\nthat have been theorized to either suppress N2O5 accommodation or decrease water availability at the surface\n[McNeill et al., 2006; Folkers et al., 2003], and v) particle\nacidity [Mozurkewich and Calvert, 1988]. These effects\nlead to measured g(N2O5) that span three orders of magnitude (1  104 < g < 0.1) depending on the chemical and\nphysical properties of the particles employed. Consistent\nwith this large potential variability, recent analyses of NO3\nand N2O5 field measurements have inferred that g(N2O5)\ncan range from 1  103 to 0.017 and is likely dependent\non particle chemical composition [Brown et al., 2006].\n[4] In the context of atmospheric particle composition,\nthe importance of the above dependences, either individually or as a whole, remains entirely unclear. Combining our\ndirect measurements of g(N2O5) on ambient particles with\nco-located observations of particle chemical composition\nand particle Sa, gas phase precursors, and meteorological\nparameters, allows such evaluations and the elucidation of\nfactors that most likely control g(N2O5) on ambient particles.\n2. Experimental Design\n[5] The pseudo-first order rate coefficient for N2O5 loss\nto aerosol particles (khet) was measured directly using an\nentrained aerosol flow reactor coupled to a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) [Kercher et al., 2009].\nThe experimental technique is described in detail elsewhere\n[Bertram et al., 2009]. Observations of g(N2O5) were made\nat two urban sampling locations during the summer of 2008.\nBetween July 3rd and 21st, observations were made from a\n10 m tower adjacent to the NOAA Earth System Research\nLaboratory in Boulder, CO. Particle size distributions (65 nm\nto 1 mm) were measured by an ultra-high sensitivity aerosol\nspectrometer and particle composition measured by an\nAerodyne compact time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer\n[DeCarlo et al., 2006; Drewnick et al., 2005]. Coincident\nmeasurements of gas-phase precursors (e.g., O3 and NO)\nand basic meteorological parameters were also made during\nthe sampling period. Between August 6th and 16th, observations were made from a 5 m sampling mast extending\nabove an instrument sea container located at the NOAA\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L19803, doi:10.1029/2009GL040248, 2009 Click\nHere for\nFull\nArticle\n1\nDepartment of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington,\nSeattle, Washington, USA. 2\nNow at Department of Chemistry, University of California, San Diego,\nLa Jolla, California, USA. 3\nDepartment of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle,\nWashington, USA. 4\nEarth System Research Laboratory, NOAA, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n5\nCIRES, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n6\nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, NOAA, Seattle, Washington,\nUSA.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276/09/2009GL040248$05.00\nL19803 1 of 5\nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, 10 km NE of\ndowntown Seattle, WA. Particle size distributions (10 nm to\n10 mm) were measured with two differential mobility\nparticle sizing instruments and aerodynamic particle sizer.\nSub-micron particle composition was measured by an\nAerodyne quadrupole aerosol mass spectrometer [Jayne et\nal., 2000].\n[6] We interpret these results using a newly developed\nparameterization of g(N2O5) [Bertram and Thornton, 2009]\nthat is driven by observations of particle composition and\nRH, and calculations of H2O(l) as determined by the aerosol\ninorganics model (AIM Model II) [Carslaw et al., 1995].\nThis approach permits us to directly assess the dependence\nof the observed g(N2O5) on the factors outlined in section 1.\n3. Observed Dependence of g(N2O5) on Particle\nChemical Composition\n[7] In Boulder, the ambient RH was low (30 ± 15%),\nparticle loadings were rather uniform (mean Sa = 108 ± 35,\ntotal mass = 5.3 ± 1.5 mg m3\n), and particles contained high\norganic mass fractions (mean organic/sulfate mass ratio =\n6.1 ± 3.9). The median g(N2O5) observed in Boulder was\n0.003 (interquartile range of 0.9– 1.2  103\n). In contrast,\nin Seattle, the ambient RH was higher (74 ± 13%), particle\nloadings were enhanced and more variable (mean Sa = 190 ±\n115, total mass = 7.2 ± 4.1 mg m3\n), but particles had similar\nbulk particle chemical composition as in Boulder (mean\norganic/sulfate = 7.1 ± 4.8). The median g(N2O5) observed\nin Seattle was 0.009 (interquartile range of 0.26 – 2.9\n102\n), a factor of three larger than measured in Boulder.\n[8] These differences in the median g(N2O5) are grossly\nconsistent with the difference in RH between the two\nlocations leading to lower H2O(l) in Boulder relative to\nSeattle. But, RH alone is not sufficient for describing either\nthe observed variability in, or the level of suppression of\ng(N2O5) relative to that expected on aqueous solution\nparticles. For example, the strongly decreasing trend of\ng(N2O5) with the increasing mass ratio of particulate\norganic matter (POM) to sulfate (SO4\n2) observed in the\nSeattle data, and the lack of such a correlation in the\nBoulder data (Figure 1a), provide insights into the particle\ncharacteristics that exert control over g(N2O5). In what\nfollows, we investigate the dependence of g(N2O5) on\nPOM, making the reasonable assumption that the aerosol\nparticles are largely internal mixtures [Murphy et al., 2006]\n(see auxiliary material).1\n[9] In the absence of POM, g(N2O5) should be controlled\nby the RH-dependent liquid water content and the molarity\nof nucleophiles such as NO3\n and chloride (Cl) [Bertram\nand Thornton, 2009; Griffiths et al., 2009; Wahner et al.,\n1998; Behnke et al., 1997]. In both locations studied, when\nPOM/SO4\n2 was lowest, the non-refractory particle composition was mainly ammonium sulfate (AS) with trace NO3\n\nand Cl (Figure S1), and our observations of g(N2O5) are in\ngood agreement with both laboratory measurements and the\nparameterization of Bertram and Thornton [2009]. Probing\nthe response of g(N2O5) to an increasing mass fraction of\nPOM, in both Boulder and Seattle, permits us to assess the\npotential affects of POM on g(N2O5). POM has been\nsuggested to influence g(N2O5) via: i) altering H2O(l),\nwhich has been shown to influence g(N2O5) either through\na direct H2O(l) limitation [Thornton et al., 2003] or by\nchanging particle [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] [Mentel et al., 1999], and/\nor ii) the formation of organic coatings on aqueous cores\nthat inhibit the accommodation or reaction of N2O5 [Badger\net al., 2006; McNeill et al., 2006; Folkers et al., 2003].\n[10] The small g(N2O5) values and lack of correlation\nwith POM observed in Boulder indicates that the particles\nsampled were either solid (independent of POM mass\nfraction) or that increases in POM did not lead to the\nassociated increase in H2O(l) required to enhance g(N2O5).\nInterestingly, our observed g(N2O5) values are consistent\nwith that predicted by the Bertram and Thornton [2009]\nparameterization regardless of the AS phase state. Laboratory measurements of g(N2O5) are <0.005 on crystalline AS\n[Mozurkewich and Calvert, 1988], similar to the median of\n0.003 observed in Boulder. If AS crystallization was\ninhibited by the available POM [Parsons et al., 2004] and\nwe treat POM as hygroscopic (i.e. malonic acid like),\nFigure 1. (a) Observed dependence of g(N2O5) on the\nmass ratio of POM to SO4\n2 for measurements made in\nSeattle (black) and Boulder (gray). (b) Calculated dependence of the molar ratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n on the mass ratio\nof POM to SO4\n2 for measurements made in Seattle,\nassuming that POM does (circles) and does not (squares)\ncontribute to H2O(l) uptake. Data points are equal\npopulation binned medians, where the bar corresponds to\nthe interquartile range of the calculations. The shaded\nregion (in panel b) represents values of [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n]\nwhere laboratory measurements predict suppression in\ng(N2O5) due to the NO3\n effect.\n1\nAuxiliary materials are available in the HTML. doi:10.1029/\n2009GL040248.\nL19803 BERTRAM ET AL.: DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF N2O5 REACTIVITY L19803\n2 of 5\ncalculations made using the Bertram and Thornton [2009]\nparameterization show that at the low RH sampled,\n[H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] is low enough to significantly suppress\ng(N2O5) to <0.005 across the entire range of POM/SO4\n2\nobserved in Boulder. Co-located measurements of g(N2O5)\nand particle phase state [Martin et al., 2008] will clearly\nallow such distinctions to be made in the future.\n[11] The behavior of g(N2O5) observed in Seattle, at\nhigher RH, more clearly illustrates the importance of\nunderstanding POM in order to assess the factors controlling g(N2O5). The dependence of g(N2O5) on POM/SO4\n2\nwas observed during a stagnation episode in which most of\nthe POM mass growth was likely due to SOA formation as\nindicated by the fraction of POM that is measured to be\nhighly oxidized (see Figure S4). In light of the above\nexpectations, the decreasing g(N2O5) with increasing\nPOM/SO4\n2 can be hypothesized to be a result of: i) a\nrelative decrease in the particulate water mass fraction,\nfollowing increased partitioning of organics that are less\nhygroscopic than AS (i.e. DH2O(l)/DPOM \u0004 0), leading to\nboth an increased nitrate effect [Wahner et al., 1998] and a\npossible H2O(l) limitation [Thornton et al., 2003], and/or\nii) an increasing role of organic coatings that limit either\nN2O5 surface accommodation or N2O5 accessibility to\nH2O(l).\n[12] To examine these suppositions, we first calculate\n[H2O(l)] and [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] using AIM for the two\nextremes of POM hygroscopicity: i) POM does not contribute to H2O(l) uptake, and ii) POM is highly hygroscopic,\ncontributing significantly to H2O(l) (POM treated as\nmalonic acid) (Figure 1b). In both cases [H2O(l)] is sufficiently high (>20M), so as not to suppress g(N2O5) directly.\nThe molar ratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n remains nearly constant\nwhen POM is allowed to contribute to H2O(l), but decreases\nwith increasing POM/SO4\n2 when POM is prohibited from\ncontributing to H2O(l). To determine whether the calculated\nchanges in [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] are sufficient for describing the\nobserved changes in g(N2O5), we use the parameterization\nfor g(N2O5) described by Bertram and Thornton [2009].\n[13] Figure 2 depicts the parameterization-observation\ncomparison for both cases as a function of the molar ratio\nof H2O(l) to NO3\n. The strong parameterization-observation\nagreement, shown in panel A, lends support to the conclusion that POM sampled in Seattle did not contribute\nsignificantly to H2O(l). Such a notion would be generally\nconsistent with the findings of Mochida et al. [2008] and\nQuinn et al. [2005], where ambient observations revealed\ndecreases in RH-dependent particle growth factors or scattering efficiency in the presence of large organic mass\nfractions. Based on our observations alone, we cannot rule\nout the possibility that organic coatings may act to offset the\neffects of hygroscopic organics (Figure 2b). Nonetheless, it\nis clear that the presence and chemical properties of POM\nplay a decisive role in setting g(N2O5) in the troposphere.\nFurther measurements of g(N2O5) downwind of source\nregions, where POM is likely more oxidized [Zhang et\nal., 2007], and more hygroscopic [Kondo et al., 2007], and/\nor alongside co-located observations of particle hygroscopic\ngrowth will be strong tests of this hypothesis and the\napplicability of these first results to regional and global\nmodels.\n4. Implications for NOx Processing Rates\n[14] Quantifying the absolute magnitude of g(N2O5) and\nultimately the loss rate of N2O5 to particles is necessary for\nreliable model representations of NOx, OH, O3, and particle\nabundances and the couplings between them. The sensitivity of the NOx budget to g(N2O5) is a strong function of the\nNO3 and N2O5 production rates, Sa, temperature, and NO3\nreactivity. To assess the importance of g(N2O5) we examine\nthe fraction of NOx present at sunset, [NOx]sunset, that is lost\nat night as a function of g(N2O5).\nFlost ¼ ½ \u0005 NOx Sunset  ½ \u0005 NOx Sunrise\n½ \u0005 NOx Sunset\nE1\nFigure 2. Comparison of parameterized [Bertram and Thornton, 2009] and observed g(N2O5) as a function of the molar\nratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n assuming (a) that POM does not contribute to H2O(l) uptake and (b) that POM contributes to H2O(l)\nuptake. Data points are separated into equal population bins, where the bar and whiskers correspond to the median to mean\nrange and the interquartile range of the observations, respectively. The parameterized g(N2O5), derived from the observed\nparticle chemical composition and RH, is shown with black solid lines and the shaded region represents the propagated\nuncertainty in its determination. The dashed black line depicts g(N2O5) as parameterized for regions where direct\nmeasurements of g(N2O5) were not available.\nL19803 BERTRAM ET AL.: DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF N2O5 REACTIVITY L19803\n3 of 5\nThe dependence of Flost on g(N2O5) and NO3 reactivity, as\ncalculated using a time-dependent chemical box model (see\nSI) for characteristic summer and winter conditions, is\nshown in Figure 3. We chose conditions (e.g., temperature\nand NO3 reactivity) in order to bracket the range of possible\nsensitivities to g(N2O5). In our summer calculations, Flost is\nprimarily limited by the NO3 production rate and nearly\nindependent of g(N2O5) due to assuming high loadings of\nbiogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), which\nincrease NO3 reactivity, and warmer temperatures, which\nshift the N2O5-NO3 equilibrium in favor of NO3. The result\nis that at high NO3 reactivity the nocturnal loss of NOx is\nindependent of g(N2O5). During winter, BVOC emissions\nare significantly smaller, and lower temperatures shift the\nN2O5-NO3 equilibrium in favor of N2O5. As a result, Flost is\nfar more sensitive to g(N2O5) during winter than in summer.\nThese calculations illustrate the acute sensitivity of the NOx\nbudget to changes in g(N2O5) between 1  104 and 0.1\nand imply that the NOx lifetime is strongly dependent on\nNO3 reactivity at low g(N2O5).\n[15] In addition to accurate predictions of the total\nnocturnal NOx loss, models must also correctly attribute\nthat loss between the N2O5 and NO3 channels to achieve a\nrealistic sensitivity of the NOx budget to changes in VOC,\ntemperature, and particle loadings. Our modeling shows this\nbranching is sensitive to g(N2O5) for the majority of likely\nconditions. The reaction products for the two channels have\ndifferent effects on oxidant concentrations and particle mass\nloadings: the products of NO3 homogeneous reactions can\nlead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol [Ng et\nal., 2008] and the heterogeneous reaction of N2O5 can lead\nto halogen activation [Finlayson-Pitts et al., 1989] or\nincreased particulate nitrate mass [Riemer et al., 2003].\n[16] When compared to predictions of g(N2O5) made\nusing two currently implemented large-scale model parameterizations [Davis et al., 2008; Evans and Jacob, 2005],\nour directly observed reactivity values are both more\nvariable and as much as a factor of ten lower, consistent\nwith reactivity values inferred from aircraft observations of\nNO3 and N2O5 [Brown et al., 2009]. If our observations\ndescribed herein are representative of other urban/suburban\nlocations, then incorporating the observed g(N2O5) into\ncurrent models would likely lead to increases in predicted\nO3 and OH, and an increased sensitivity of NOx loss to both\nNO3 reactivity and particle loadings.\n5. Conclusions\n[17] We present an analysis of the first direct measurements of g(N2O5) on ambient aerosol particles. At the limit\nof low POM, our observations confirm RH as a primary\ncontrol and particulate nitrate as a secondary control in\nregulating g(N2O5). Observations at high RH illustrate a\nstrong dependence of g(N2O5) on particle POM/SO4\n2. Our\nrecent parameterization [Bertram and Thornton, 2009] can\nadequately capture the trend and variability in the observed\ng(N2O5) if we make the assumption that the increasing\nPOM mass fractions do not contribute significantly to\nadditional particulate water uptake at the same RH. In such\na case, the nitrate effect is sufficient to explain our results. If\nPOM does contribute to H2O(l) uptake, then our results\nsuggest an additional means of suppressing g(N2O5) that is\ncorrelated with oxidized POM such as organic coatings.\nRegardless, these results clearly indicate that regional and\nglobal modeling efforts need to consider the effects of\nparticulate organic loadings and hygroscopicity in parameterizing the rate of nocturnal NOx loss via N2O5 reactions\non particles.\n[18] Acknowledgments.

The UN OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data worked with a wide range\nof technical partners to develop a methodology that was then endorsed by the Somalia ICCG\nand HCT.\nDaily FloodScan (1998-2022) & WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) raster data was analysed to gain\nunderstanding of ood conditions across Somalia for both March-April-May (MAM) and\nOctober-November-December (OND) seasons. FloodScan daily ood fraction Standard Flood\nExposure Depiction (SFED) was aggregated to yearly seasonal maximum fraction composites\nfor both the MAM and OND seasons for all years of historical FloodScan data (1998-2022).\nThe yearly seasonal SFED composites were then processed/reclassied in two distinct ways:\n1. Composites reclassied to binary using a 20 percent ood fraction threshold.\n2. Composites masked to just remove any ood fraction values < 0.05 percent and the\nood fraction (0-100 percent) retained.\nAll composites in both sets of processed yearly-seasonal ood fraction rasters were then\nmultiplied by the WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) population estimate raster to create two sets of\nyearly seasonal ood exposure rasters. These were then aggregated at the second\nadministrative level via zonal statistics (sum) to obtain the estimated population exposure per\ndistrict for each season across all years for each set. These estimates were converted to the\npercent of population exposed by dividing the estimates by the total population per district\n(from World Pop raster). The percent exposure gure was then applied to the updated 2024\npopulation data set (UN OCHA, UNFPA Methodology) to obtain updated population exposure\nestimates. These data were further aggregated to administrative level 1.\nRanges for exposure were estimated using percentiles for both the MAM and OND seasons per\nadministrative level. As ECMWF seasonal forecast predicts an above average precipitation\nseason for MAM 2024, the range of population exposed was based on the 50th-95th percentile\nlevels. Since there was no available data to inform predictions for OND 2024, the 25-75th\npercentile values were used to bound the range. The lower and upper limits of the ranges were\nPage 1 of 2\ncalculated at the administrative level using all of the historical yearly seasonal ood exposure\nestimates. The two sets of range estimates were combined conservatively by taking the\nmaximum value for both the upper and lower bounds for each season.\nContact the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data via Leonardo Milano, Team Lead for Data\nScience at leonardo.milano@un.org with any questions or feedback.\nPage 2 of 2"

These events can exploit or exacerbate existing\nvulnerabilities.1\n In some cases, they may also create new vulnerabilities that can increase the risk of future\ndata incidents.\nHumanitarians have not had a common understanding of what comprises a data incident, nor is there\na minimum technical standard for how these incidents should be prevented and managed. How the\nhumanitarian sector develops tools and implements procedures for data incident management will play\na significant role in the evolution of the ethical, human rights, technical, and professional standards of\nhumanitarian operations.\n1 “A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by\n a threat source.” NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\nGUIDANCE NOTE SERIES\nDATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION\nDATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n• Humanitarian data incidents are events involving the management of data that have caused\nharm or have the potential to cause harm to crisis-affected people, organizations and their\noperations, and other individuals or groups.\n• Examples of humanitarian data incidents include physical breaches of infrastructure,\nunauthorised disclosure of data, and the use of beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes,\namong others.\n• A data incident has four aspects: (i) a threat source, (ii) a threat event, (iii) a vulnerability and (iv)\nan adverse impact.\n• There are five steps to responding to data incidents: (i) notification, (ii) classification, (iii)\ntreatment, and (iv) closure of the incident, as well as (v) learning.\n“If aid actors digitize more of their data and communications, they urgently\n need to increase their digital security efforts. Though some actors are\n developing promising protective tools, aid organizations overall might be\n well advised to listen to a quote from IT-security circles: ‘There are two\n types of organizations: those who have been hacked, and those who will be.”\n- Rahel Dette, Do No Digital Harm: Mitigating Technology Risk in Humanitarian Contexts\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 2\nDEFINITIONS AND FRAMEWORKS FOR UNDERSTANDING DATA INCIDENTS\nGovernments and the private sector have developed definitions and frameworks for understanding data\nincidents that serve as helpful references for the humanitarian sector.\n• The International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) in ISO Standard 27000 defines a ‘critical\nincident’ as “a single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information security events that have a\nsignificant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security.”2\n• The United States Department of Commerce National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)\ndefines an adverse event involving a ‘cyber threat’ as “[a]n event or condition that has the potential\nfor causing asset loss and the undesirable consequences or impact from such loss.”3\n• Mahmood Sher-Jan of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) identifies three\nadditional categories of events that expand upon the NIST definition of adverse events. These are, in\norder of escalating severity: security incidents; privacy incidents; and data breaches.4\n2 International Organization for Standardization, ISO/IEC 27000:2018.\n3 NIST Computer Security Resource Center Glossary.\n4 IAPP, Is It an Incident or a Breach, How to Tell and Why It Matters, Mahmoud Sher-Jan (February 2017).\n5 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nHumanitarian data incidents may include physical breaches of infrastructure, unauthorised disclosure of\ndata, and the use of ‘anonymised’ beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes, among others. Data\nincidents can also occur without technical infrastructure being compromised in any way. The legitimate\ncollection, use, and sharing of data by humanitarians can still have operational implications that may\nconstitute a data incident in cases where rumors, cultural sensitivities, political dynamics, and other\nfactors lead to adverse effects linked to the data.\nExamples of possible humanitarian data incidents\nA data incident has four factors: a threat source, a threat event, a vulnerability and an adverse impact.5\nBelow are two types of hypothetical data incidents that could occur in humanitarian contexts.\nThe first scenario is a typical data breach incident situated in the context of an armed conflict. The\nsecond is an example of the type of vulnerabilities that can initiate data incidents unique to the\nhumanitarian sector.\n1. Unauthorized access to data occurs [impact] due to armed actors [source] raiding a facility and\nseizing hard-drives containing beneficiary data [event]. The hard-drives were unencrypted\n[vulnerability].\n2. Absence of guidance limiting data collection for a specific purpose [vulnerability] leads to staff\ncollecting data about the marital status of pregnant women [source]. A data breach [event] later\noccurs, resulting in an increased chance of physical violence [impact] against unwed pregnant\nbeneficiaries.\nThese scenarios demonstrate how to think about identifying causal chains that may create contextspecific data incidents. \nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 3\n6 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nRISK MODELS\nThe figure below presents a generic risk model with risk factors that organizations can use to understand\nhow a data incident may occur. A threat event exploits an existing vulnerability that is either magnified by\npredisposing conditions or mitigated by security controls already in place. This causes adverse impacts that\nproduce organizational risk, which can include risks for the organization and for affected people.\nFigure 1. “Generic Risk Model with Key Risk Factors”. Source: NIST Special Publication\n800-30 pg. 126\nThe figure below presents one example of how this generic risk model could be adapted to the\nhumanitarian sector.\nFigure 2. Risk Model with Key Risk Factors adapted to a humanitarian context.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 4\nHumanitarian organizations can develop their own specific risk models for data incident management\nincorporating these factors. The nature of these risk factors and how they come together to constitute a\ndata incident will vary from one organization to another and should be adapted to specific operational\nrealities.\nSTEPS IN DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nAfter clearly defining what constitutes a data incident, organizations can develop Standard Operating\nProcedures (SOPs) for data incident management.\nData incident management SOPs should include the following 5 steps: 1) notification, 2) classification;\n3) treatment; 4) closure; and 5) knowledge base.7\n7 The Centre for Humanitarian Data provides several sources of guidance that can inform the development of Data Incident Management SOPs on\n the Data Responsibility page.\n8 How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16, Antonio Jose Segovia, (October 2015.).\n9 For humanitarian organizations, an example of such a classification is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of\n Patient Safety, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\n10 WHO, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\nFigure 3: Five steps in the treatment of security incidents (Source: How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16,\nAntonio Jose Segovia8\nThe application of these steps in an organization can look as follows:\n1. Notification of the incident: A person detects an incident and notifies relevant colleagues according\nto the communication procedures of the organization (usually an email, a phone call, a software tool,\netc.). A notification should contain, if possible, a description of the key risk factors involved in the\nincident: source, event, vulnerability and impact.\n2. Classification of the incident: The recipient of the notification classifies the incident based on it’s\nimpact (high, medium or low) and the urgency of treatment (high, medium or low).9\n Managing risk\nbegins with classifying all incidents, whether or not tangible harm actually results from them.10\n3. Treatment of the incident: A technical expert decides on the necessary measures to treat the incident\nonce the incident has been classified and the time for treatment has been agreed.\n4. Closure of the incident: All information generated during the treatment is recorded and the person\nwho first sent notification of the incident is informed that the incident is closed.\n5. Knowledge base: All information generated during the treatment of the incident is used to inform and\ntrain colleagues and as reference material for future similar incidents.\nHumanitarian organizations can base their SOPs on this 5-step model, describing how each step should\ntake place within their organization. This should include the functions/roles and teams within an\norganization that are responsible at each stage of the process. These steps should be incorporated into\nor extended from existing incident response protocols (e.g. security incident management related to\nhumanitarian access).\nIn a given response context, organizations should also work to integrate any joint incident management\nprocedures into existing coordination structures, such as the clusters and mechanisms for inter- and\nintra-cluster coordination.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 5\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT IN\nHUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS\nIntroducing or improving data incident management in humanitarian operations is critical to more\nresponsible data practice in the sector. The Centre for Humanitarian Data recommends that organizations\nfocus on the following areas:\n1. Establish a common understanding of data incident management\nUse a risk model to understand the causal chain that can lead to data incidents for specific offices and\nsystems. Identify key threat actors and vulnerabilities for offices and systems and understand existing\nsecurity controls and their effectiveness. Finally, map existing data incident management capacity\nand determine whether it is positioned appropriately. Once clear definitions and processes are\narticulated, invest in staff awareness and support a culture of open dialogue about incidents, in which\nproactive reporting and management of incidents is incentivized, not punished.\n2. Strengthen data incident management capacity\nTake measures to put in place security controls to mitigate the risk of data incidents, and share best\npractice with partners. Build on existing work in the sector to fill governance gaps which can create\nvulnerabilities for your organization. Engage with organizational partners to set up information\nchannels around data incidents. Share known vulnerabilities in a controlled manner with trusted\ncounterparts for cross-organizational learning.\n3. Support continuous learning\nSupport learning and development of improved data incident management practices by organizing\ntraining and drills based on scenarios likely to occur in different operational settings. These exercises\nshould occur regularly and may even involve multiple organizations training and drilling together. In\naddition, document actual data incidents as cases for internal knowledge development.\nOrganizations are encouraged to share their experience in the development of data incident management\nwith the Centre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.\nThis project is co-funded\nby the European Union\nThis document covers humanitarian aid activities implemented with the financial assistance of the\nEuropean Union.

Peer Review Framework for Predictive Analytics\nin Humanitarian Response\nMODEL REPORT:\nDrought Anticipatory Action\nTrigger in Niger\nAnticipatory Action Working Group, Niger\nJanuary 2023\nModel Report:\nAnticipatory Action Trigger for Drought in Niger\n1. Background\nThis document summarizes the documentation and ndings developed in the peer review of the\nAnticipatory Action Trigger for Drought in Niger. The trigger mechanism was designed for an\nanticipatory action framework coordinated by OCHA. The goal of the trigger mechanism is to\ndetect increased drought risk in Niger and trigger the release of funds from the Central\nEmergency Response Fund in anticipation of drought-related humanitarian needs. The release\nof funds can be triggered from six months ahead of the rainy season (which runs from July\nthrough September) until one month into the season. The trigger mechanism includes a\npredictive model that uses seasonal precipitation forecasts and an observational model that\nuses the Standardized Precipitation Index.\nThe review was conducted between May 2022 and January 2023.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nThe documentation describing the model and its application, as well as the outcomes of the\nreview process, are available through the following links:\n● The Model Card describes version 1 of the trigger mechanism. It was completed by\nOCHA in June 2022 and updated in October 2022.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix presents the outcomes of the technical review and was\ncompleted by Mohammad Shamsudduha, Associate Professor in Humanitarian Science\nat the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London, in December\n2022.\n● The Implementation Plan summarizes the concrete actions that the trigger mechanism\nwill inform and was developed by OCHA in October 2022.\n● The Ethical Matrix identies issues that may come up in the implementation of the\ntrigger mechanism and stakeholders that may be impacted by those issues. The Ethical\nMatrix was completed in January 2023 by Andrea Romaoli Garcia, ITU Topic Driver on\nOpen Code.\nThe sections below provide a summary of the main ndings and recommendations developed in\nthe review.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The intended use of the predictive model is appropriate.\n● The model may not detect localized rainfall shortages, which could lead to the model\nmissing a trigger where it should detect increased drought risk. In addition, crop failure\ndepends on a number of factors other than rainfall, including the use and availability of\ngroundwater for irrigation as well as changes in temperature. The fact that these\nadditional factors are not included in the model should be considered in the\ninterpretation of model outputs.\nModel Development and Documentation\n● The resolution of the spatial coverage of the predictive model is very high at 0.05\ndegrees. The predictive model produces outputs on a monthly basis. The geographic\nscope of the predictive model includes the entire country of Niger. These parameters are\nappropriate for a national-scale model.\n● The spatial resolution of the predictive model at 0.05 degrees is too high given that the\npredictive model is primarily dependent on precipitation variability. Correlation between\nforecasts and observational rainfall data produced by CHIRPS is weak in Maradi and\nNiamey regions, where the irrigation is the highest in the country.\nModel Evaluation\n● The predictive model is evaluated using accuracy, hit rate, miss rate, false positives and\nfalse negatives as parameters. These model evaluation criteria are appropriate for this\npredictive model.\n● A comparison between the predictive model outputs and NextGen forecasts was based\nonly on CHIRPS gridded rainfall data. No detailed information is provided on the\ndownscaling of the forecasts and evaluation of the downscaled technique.\nOperational Readiness\n● Activities and funding are provided on a “no-regrets” basis after a trigger activation.\nActivities and funding are purposefully selected to still be valuable in the absence of a\nshock. The addition of an observational trigger based on SPI is a strength of this\nanticipatory trigger mechanism.\n● The forecast accuracy could be improved if the predictive model is tailored to individual\nareas within Niger.\n● There is little mention of local/national capacity building or strengthening in the process.\n● The performance of the predictive model should be evaluated against the observational\nmodel outputs to better understand the weaknesses in the predictive model.\nStrengthening the predictive model outputs increases the potential impact of the trigger\nmechanism due to the increased lead time.\n● The low or even negative correlation between the predictive model outputs and CHIRPS\nprecipitation in the northern part of Niger should be examined to improve the\nperformance and validity of the predictive model.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nFalse negative activation (non-activation in the presence of a shock)\n● A false negative would deprive the community of timely aid.\n● Recommendation: The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously evaluated\nagainst the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS precipitation data to\nlower the likelihood of false negatives.\nFalse positive activation (activation in the absence of a shock)\n● A false positive would increase the risk of wasted nancial resources. Such error could\nundermine the condence of stakeholders and donors and could lead to discontinuation\nof the trigger mechanism. A false negative primarily impacts other stakeholders,\nincluding local NGOs, the model developers and UN entities, due to the misallocation of\nresources. It also undermines trust in the trigger mechanism.\n● Recommendation: A false positive is more tolerable compared to a false negative, as a\nfalse positive triggers activities and funding that benet the population even in the\nabsence of a shock. The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously\nevaluated against the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS\nprecipitation data to lower the likelihood of false positives.\nIdentity exposure (exposure of individual identities through potential use of additional data\nsources in implementation of the model)\n● Unauthorized access to any personal data used in future implementation of the trigger\nmechanism could cause harm and carries reputational risk.\n● Recommendation: Given that the trigger mechanism does not include the use of any\npersonal data there is little concern that a data breach could result in re-identication. If\nthe implementation of the trigger mechanism evolves over time to include additional\npersonal data, the tools and infrastructure used in implementation should be\nre-evaluated and adjusted as needed to mitigate the risk of identity exposure.\nBias in available data\n● Bias in data availability resulting from gaps in data for different regions in Niger could\naffect the allocation of funding and activities.\n● Recommendation: Determine whether there are gaps resulting in biases in climate data\navailability for Niger in order to prevent unfair allocation of funding and activities.\nFeedback\nThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic, research and\nprivate sector to engage with us on the peer review process.

Background\nThis report summarises the documentation and ndings of the peer review of the trigger used in\nUN OCHA’s Burkina Faso Anticipatory Action framework for drought. The impact prediction\nmodel used as a basis for this trigger was developed by the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data\nPredictive Analytics team. The go-no-go trigger mechanism is based on the IRI seasonal rainfall\nforecast, with a threshold dependent on geographical coverage and below-average rainfall\nprobability. To nd out more, please see the Anticipatory Action Framework for Burkina Faso.\nThe review has been conducted between May and December 2022.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nYou can nd all the documentation regarding the model, its application and the review process\nat the following links:\n● The Model Card describes version 1.0 of the model and was completed in May 2022.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix was completed in July 2022 by a technical expert from the\nRed Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n● The Implementation Plan was completed in October 2022. It summarises the concrete\nactions that the model will trigger or inform as part of the 2021 OCHA anticipatory action\nframework in Burkina Faso.\n● The Ethical Matrix aims to identify all stakeholders and potential issues regarding the\nintended use of the model. The Ethical Matrix was completed by an expert from DFID in\nNovember 2022.\nA summary of the main ndings and recommendations is provided below.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The model is simple and scalable; however, an alternative source of forecast should be\nused for verication, and other drought indicators such as dry spells considered.\n● Clarication is required on the mismatch between drought return periods, and how\ngeographical targeting is performed given the coarse resolution.\nModel Development and Documentation\n● Additional verication metrics are required to increase the condence of the trigger, in\nparticular due to the limited hindcast.\n● More clarity is needed on how the minimum required area of below average precipitation\nof 10% was chosen, and the exact thresholds used across lead times and activation\nwindows should be specied.\nModel Evaluation\n● The model uncertainty was clearly communicated and accepted by stakeholders.\n● A strategy to increase model trust is lacking. For example, the methodology could be\nsubmitted to a peer-review / academic journal for review once it is more mature.\n● Discussion on potential negative risks due to interventions occurring in a\nconict-affected country is very much needed.\nOperational Readiness\n● The model was developed collaboratively and is ready to be piloted.\n● The choice of forecasting information and baseline for verication should be\nre-examined to improve trust in the trigger system.\n● More reection on the potential negative effects of a false alarm is required.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nEffectiveness: Regional Selection\nThe motivation behind the selection of targeted regions is unclear, and in particular, is missing Est,\nwhich has been identied as high-risk across several factors, including food insecurity.\n● Recommendation: Expand the explanation on the selection of the four regions, in\nparticular why Est was not included and Boucle de Mouhoun was.\nEffectiveness: Focus on Drought\nThe cause of food insecurity in Burkina Faso is linked with several factors in addition to drought,\nincluding conict, agricultural practice, supply chain disruptions and food prices.\n● Recommendation: Better justify the selection of rainfall as the sole trigger and why other\nfactors were not included.\nEffectiveness: Sub-regional Targeting\nIt is unclear if and how sub-districts with projected IPC-5 will be targeted.\n● Recommendation: Include more details on how districts and communities most in need\nwill be targeted by the UN agencies implementing the interventions.\nEciency and Feasibility: Best Use of Resources\nWith the Burkina Faso HRP being severely underfunded, it is unclear whether this anticipatory\naction pilot diverts funding away from more urgent needs identied by the Food Security Cluster.\n● Recommendation: Discuss the potential impacts that $15 million could have on the\nregion or globally and compare to the impacts of the no-regrets approach.\nEciency and Feasibility: Maximise Collective Action and Avoid Duplication\nThe rationale for the choice of model, and how it helps leverage common resources and avoid\nduplication, is lacking.\n● Recommendation: Expand the framework to discuss how the model complements\nexisting early warning and food insecurity mitigation efforts in Burkina Faso, such as\nFEWS NET and CH/IPC.\nEciency and feasibility: Risk/harm-benet Analysis\nA risk/harm-benet analysis is required to understand ethical and nancial risks and is missing\nfrom the framework.\n● Recommendation: Perform a full risk/harm-benet analysis.\nAccountability and Community Participation\nThe implementation plan makes little reference to affected communities, local organizations and\nauthorities in the design of the framework.\n● Recommendation: The framework should include activities to engage and explain the\nmodel to local civil society, affected populations and authorities.\n● Recommendation: Explain why there were no partnerships formed with ECOWAS,\nUEMOA and the RCPA.\nNeutrality, Impartiality and Conict-sensitivity\nIt is unclear how much the framework takes into account the presence of conict in the region.\n● Recommendation: Investigate the feasibility of carrying out a detailed conict sensitivity\nassessment.\nTrustworthiness and Reliability\nOutstanding questions remain on choice of forecast, and whether other options were considered.\n● Recommendation: Expand the explanation of why the IRI dataset was the only one used.\nTransparency and Explainability\nNo information on how an external actor can learn how the model works and understand the basis\nof the trigger decisions.\n● Recommendation: Amend the framework to include activities that engage and explain\nthe model to local civil society, affected populations and authorities.\nHuman in the Loop\nNo human stop mechanism specied per the recommendation of the Ethiopia evaluation.\n● Recommendation: Investigate the possibility of including a stop mechanism.\nFeedback\nThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic, research and\nprivate sector to engage with us on the peer review process. Please send feedback on the Peer Review\nFramework to centrehumdata@un.org."

This guidance note deals with sensitive personal and non-personal data.\n2 Roepstorff, K., Faltas, C. and Hövelmann, S., 2020.

Some of these requests relate to sensitive information and data which needs to\nbe protected in order to mitigate risk.\n• Common objectives for data sharing with donors include: (i) situational awareness and\nprogramme design; (ii) accountability and transparency; and (iii) legal, regulatory, and policy\nrequirements.\n• Common constraints related to sharing data with donors include: (i) lack of regulatory framework\nfor responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data; (ii) capacity gaps; and (iii) purpose\nlimitation.\n• Donors and humanitarian organizations can take the following steps to minimize risks while\nmaximizing benefits when sharing sensitive data: (i) reviewing and clarifying the formal or\ninformal frameworks that govern the collection and sharing of disaggregated data; (ii) formalizing\nand standardising requests for sensitive data; (iii) investing in data management capacities of\nstaff and organisations; and (iv) adopting common principles for donor data management.\nINTRODUCTION\nDonors have an important role in the humanitarian data ecosystem, both as drivers of increased data\ncollection and analysis, and as direct users of data. This is not a new phenomenon; the need for\naccountability and transparency in the use of donor funding is broadly understood and respected. However,\nin recent years, donors have begun requesting data that can be sensitive. This includes personal data about\nbeneficiaries and various forms of disaggregated data, such as household-level survey results and data\nabout the delivery of assistance disaggregated by demographic and/or group dimensions (e.g. ethnicity,\nprotection group, etc.).1\nConcerns around requests for such data have led donors and humanitarian organizations to place more\nemphasis on identifying strategies for data responsibility: the safe, ethical and effective management\nof data. Data responsibility requires donors and humanitarian organizations to take actions that help\nminimize risks while maximizing benefits of data. This is particularly challenging in cases where donors\nrequest sensitive data. For example, the screening of aid recipients, which is often used to justify requests\nfor personal data, is not only difficult to practically implement, but also highly problematic in terms of\nprincipled aid.2\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 2\n3\n Non-personal data is defined as data which was initially personal data, but later made anonymous, such as data about the people affected by the\n humanitarian situation and their needs, the threats and vulnerabilities they face, and their capacities (adapted from Regulation (EU)\n 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the\n European Union).\n4\n See the Working Draft OCHA Guidelines for Data Responsibility and the ICRC Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action.\n5\n Read more about the virtual dialogue in this Wilton Park Report.\n6 Willits-King, B. and Spencer, A., 2020. Responsible data-sharing with donors: accountability, transparency and data protection in principled\n humanitarian action.\n7\n At the time of writing, only USAID and GIZ had publicly available guidelines on responsible data sharing. See USAID, 2019. Considerations for using\n data responsibly at USAID and GIZ, 2018. GIZ’s Responsible Data Principles.\n8 Willits-King, B. and Spencer, A., 2020. Responsible data-sharing with donors: accountability, transparency and data protection in principled\n humanitarian action.\nIn addition, sharing seemingly innocuous data such as aggregated survey results can place already\nvulnerable people and communities at greater risk. What may be initially considered non-personal data3\ncan allow for re-identification of individuals, communities and demographic groups. Re-identification\noccurs when data can be traced back or linked to an individual(s) or group(s) of individuals because it is not\nadequately anonymized. This can result in a violation of data protection, privacy and other human rights\nand can allow for targeting of individuals or groups with violence or other forms of harm.4\nMany donors and humanitarian actors recognize the risks and benefits associated with sharing such\nsensitive data, but the sector has yet to establish a common understanding of how to balance these risks\nand benefits effectively. Recent efforts to address this issue have led to more clarity on current practices,\nas well as on the objectives and constraints of data sharing. In September 2020, the Government of\nSwitzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Office for\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) Centre for Humanitarian Data (the Centre) organized a\nvirtual Wilton Park dialogue to help build common understanding on this issue.5\nThis guidance note synthesizes the outcomes of this dialogue and a related desk review.6\n It describes the\nchallenges around sharing sensitive data with donors and offers initial recommendations for how donors\nand humanitarian organizations can more effectively navigate this area.\nDONOR REQUESTS FOR DATA\nDonors regularly request data from their partners in order to fulfil different obligations and objectives.\nThese requests can be either formal or informal.\n• Formal requests tend to be included in grant agreements in relation to reporting criteria, and are\ntypically based on legal requirements such as compliance with counter-terrorism laws. Such requests\ntend to be negotiated at the outset of a partnership or grant agreement, and are usually made in\nwriting and scheduled in advance.\n• Informal requests concern information or data that typically fall outside of the normal scope  of\nreporting. These ad-hoc requests often carry implicit value, meaning that while they are not\nformally required, delivering this supplementary data is deemed beneficial for an organization’s\nongoing engagement and partnership with a donor. These requests represent a greater dilemma for\nhumanitarian actors.\nFew donors have formal data sharing policies or guidelines in place.7\n There is also a lack of shared\nunderstanding of terminology and of the objectives and risks around data sharing. There are different\ndefinitions and understanding of data-related risks, leading to inconsistent and sometimes contradictory\npractices around sharing potentially sensitive data with donors in a particular context.8\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 3\n9 See NRC's Toolkit for Principled Humanitarian Action; Managing CT Risks.\n10 In order to ensure compliance, donors might request highly disaggregated data to corroborate their due diligence processes, ensuring their partners\n are not engaging with any ‘sanctioned’ person or entity’. See Walker, J., 2020. Compliance Dialogue on Syria-Related Humanitarian Payments.\n ‘Sanctioned persons’ is a general term which may include individuals, terrorist groups, governments as well as companies and other entities of legal\n personality. The EU, for example, has over the years considerably strengthened its legal framework for preventing money laundering and terrorism\n financing in recent years and is constantly enforcing in. See: NGO Voice, 2020. The Impact of EU Sanctions and Restrictive Measures on\n Humanitarian Action.\n11 Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Humanitarian Financing Task Team (HFTT), 2016. Donor Conditions and their implications for\n humanitarian response.\n12 Publish What You Fund, 2020. Data Use Capacity in Protracted Humanitarian Crises.\nCONSTRAINTS FOR DATA SHARING WITH DONORS\nDespite these objectives, data sharing with donors is not without its constraints, which include a lack of\nregulatory frameworks for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data, capacity gaps and lack of\npurpose limitation.\nLack of regulatory frameworks for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data\nThe sensitivity of personal data is generally well-known and addressed by a variety of policy and regulatory\nframeworks, but the same cannot be said for sensitive non-personal data. Protecting groups and their\ndata remains challenging due to the current gaps in regulation and guidance and the overall lack of\nunderstanding regarding the sensitivity of non-personal data. These data policy gaps increase the risk of\nsensitive data not being stored or protected adequately or shared inadvertently by partners in order to\nsatisfy donors’ requests.\nCapacity gaps\nResponding to ad-hoc data sharing requests from donors can be viewed as an additional burden to\nhumanitarian responders, diverting critical time, resources and focus away from other implementing\nactivities.11 Insufficient funding for data-related capacity development has limited many organizations’\nability to provide their staff with the skills and resources required for managing data responsibly.12 Gaps\nin capacity to fulfil donor requirements might also deter smaller and/or local NGOs from seeking funding,\nundermining localization efforts.13\nOBJECTIVES FOR DATA SHARING WITH DONORS\nThe most commonly identified objectives for donors requesting sensitive data from partners are\nsituational awareness and programme design; accountability and transparency; and legal, regulatory, and\npolicy requirements.\nSituational awareness and programme design\nDonors seek information and data from humanitarian organizations in order to understand and react\nto changes in humanitarian contexts. This allows donors to improve their own programme design and\nevaluation, prevent duplication of assistance, identify information gaps, and ensure appropriate targeting\nof assistance.\nAccountability and transparency\nDonors and humanitarian organizations have an obligation to account for their activities. Data can enable\ndonors to explain and defend funding on foreign aid to taxpayers.\nLegal, regulatory, and policy requirements\nDonors are subject to certain national and international legal requirements, including political, legal and\nstatutory requirements related to counter-terrorism, migration and law enforcement. In many cases,\ndonors might want to use data to verify their compliance with these different requirements. Some donors\ninclude counterterrorism clauses in their grant agreements, which are intended to ensure that their funds\nare not used to benefit designated terrorist groups.9\n Similarly, donors might include clauses to cover antibribery, anti-fraud and anti-corruption measures.10\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 4\n14 ICRC, 2020. Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action.\n15 Examples include the Good Humanitarian Donorship Initiative and the Grand Bargain.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nIn view of the objectives and constraints detailed above, the Centre, the Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG)\nat ODI, the ICRC, and the Human Security Division of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs\nrecommend that donors and humanitarian organizations take the following steps to minimize risks while\nmaximizing benefits when sharing sensitive data:\n• Reviewing and clarifying the formal or informal frameworks that govern the collection and\nsharing of disaggregated data\nDonors and partners should examine the official, formal requirements and ad-hoc, informal\nrequirements of data sharing, and analyse partner and donor staff interpret whether requirements\ncorrectly and consistently. They should assess whether there are implicit conditionalities between the\nwillingness to share disaggregated data and the ability of different organizations to access and sustain\nfunding from donors.\n• Formalizing and standardizing requests for sensitive data\nWhen sensitive data is required to meet a mutually agreed objective, donors should formalize and\nstandardize their requests for such data. Requests should be made in writing and should specify\nwhich data is requested, the format desired, and the intended use of the data. Donors should only\nrequest the information required to meet the specified purpose for which it is being requested and\nshould indicate a timeline for destruction of the data. Humanitarian organisations should document\nall requests for data and ensure consistency in responding to these requests over time.\n• Investing in data management capacities of staff and organizations\nDonors and humanitarian organizations should identify opportunities to invest in building data\nmanagement expertise especially for non-technical staff. The donor community is uniquely positioned\nto encourage data responsibility by providing additional resources for training and capacity building.\n• Adopting common principles for donor data management\nThe sector already has a range of principles and commitments to inform different aspects of\nhumanitarian donorship.15 However, these do not sufficiently address concerns related to data\nresponsibility. Donors and partners should engage in the development of common principles and\nguidelines for donor data sharing to fill this gap. The Humanitarian Data and Trust Initiative, co-led\nby the Government of Switzerland, the ICRC, and the Centre, offers a platform to facilitate this process\nas part of its ongoing work to build trust through dialogue.\nOrganizations are encouraged to share their experience in responsible data sharing with donors with the\nCentre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.\nPurpose limitation\nThe principle of purpose limitation requires that data is only collected for specified, explicit and legitimate\npurposes, and that it not be processed further in a manner that would be incompatible with those\npurposes.14 Even when donors specify legitimate reasons for requesting data in-line with the original\npurposes for which the data was collected (e.g. the delivery of humanitarian assistance), it can be difficult\nto ensure that the data will not be used for other purposes once shared. Data used out of context and for\npurposes that are not known at the time of sharing, or retained past the intended retention for a defined\npurpose represents a violation, even if unintended, of the data subjects’ rights.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 5\nThis project is co-funded\nby the European Union\nThis document covers humanitarian aid activities implemented with the financial assistance of the\nEuropean Union. The views expressed herein should not be taken, in any way, to reflect the official opinion\nof the European Union, and the European Commission is not responsible for any use that may be made of\nthe information it contains.\nCOLLABORATORS: THE HUMANITARIAN POLICY GROUP AT ODI; INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS;\nAND THE HUMAN SECURITY DIVISION, SWISS FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.\nThe Centre for Humanitarian Data ('the Center'), together with key partners, is publishing a series of eight\nguidance notes on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action over the course of 2019 and 2020. The Guidance\nNote series follows the publication of the OCHA Data Responsibility Guidelines in March 2019. Through\nthe series, the Centre aims to provide additional guidance on specific issues, processes and tools for data\nresponsibility in practice.

Background\nThis document summarises the documentation and the nding of the peer review of the trigger\nused in OCHA’s Philippines Anticipatory Action framework for typhoons. The impact prediction\nmodel used as the basis for the trigger was developed by the Netherlands Red Cross 510 data\nand digital team, on behalf of the IFRC network and its partners. The model uses typhoon track\nand rainfall forecasts to predict the percentage of houses that will be severely damaged per\nmunicipality in the Philippines. OCHA Philippines used this model as a basis to begin a response\nbefore a typhoon hit, based on the predicted number of houses damaged in the regions of Bicol\nand Eastern Visayas. To nd out more about this application, please see the Anticipatory Action\nFramework for the Philippines.\nThis peer review was conducted between September 2021 and July 2022.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nThe documentation regarding the model, its application and the review process can be found at\nthe following links:\n● The Model Card describes version 1.0 of the model and was completed in September\n2021.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix was completed in October 2021 by a technical expert from\nLeiden University, and in February 2022 by the client.\n● The Implementation Plan was completed in October 2021. It summarises the concrete\nactions that the model will trigger or inform as part of the 2021-2022 OCHA anticipatory\naction framework in the Philippines\n● The Ethical Matrix aims to identify all stakeholders and potential issues regarding the\nintended use of the model. It was completed in November 2021 by an expert from the\nLondon School of Economics; and updated in July 2022.\nA summary of the main ndings and recommendations is provided below.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The target of the model is P (#damaged houses > threshold t). Several combinations of\nProbability P and threshold t are used as a trigger for early action. Make a clear\nstatement under which circumstance which combination is used. This will help with later\nevaluation of the model and transparency of its use.\nModel Development\n● As mentioned in the ethical review, more information about the sources of the input data\nis desirable. The model should include information on how often the data sets are\nupdated, and how often the model is retrained to reect these updates.\nModel Evaluation\n● The model is compared against a damage curve that is currently used to estimate\ndamage. Adjust this benchmark to whichever model or algorithm is used by the\nPhilippine authorities to estimate damage.\n● Specify how much variance in model performance is acceptable, i.e., with the model\nworking on average better than the benchmark, how much extreme over /\nunderestimation is acceptable for eld use. More specically, indicate how robust the\nmodel performance is over different typhoons.\nOperational Readiness\n● For every model version, make a model release and keep an updated list of associated\ninput data. This will make reproducibility of earlier results easier and help keep track of\nthe data sources (and whose responsibility those are).\n2.2 Ethical Review\nInaccuracy\nThe model performance scores for 2021 Typhoon Surigae are not reported. The rationale for\nusing the given error / accuracy tool and not others is missing. The model does not perform well\nat predicting really low and really high damage.\n● Recommendation: (1) Report latest error scores; (2) Contextualise the quality of the error\nscores in light of existing and relevant research; (3) Include the rationale for using a\nparticular method of calculating error score as opposed to others.\nFalse Negatives\nIn the case of Typhoon Goni in 2020, the model did not predict an extreme event until only a few\nhours before landfall.\n● Recommendation: If the model does have 100% weightage in the activation of the\ntrigger, then the possibility of a false negative should be clear operationally, e.g., in the\ncase of Typhoon Goni. This is of particular importance because we know that the model\ndoes perform well in cases of rapid intensication or high damage scenarios.\nMissing Attributes\nThe implementation model mentions a priority list based on poverty, gender, and building material,\nwhile the model uses poverty, hazard data, and building type where poverty is not disaggregated\nunless it follows some national standard of income levels to estimate poverty lines.\n● Recommendation: Clarity is required on the relative importance of variables used, and\nconsistency between the model and the implementation plan. There needs to be a\ndistinction drawn between the model and how the outputs of the model are used. Clear\ndelineation between input data (inclusion / exclusion criteria etc.); modelling process,\noutput, and use; and validation / verication, with a clear trail of documentation.\nLead Times\nLead time is the length of time between when a forecast is output and the occurrence of the\nshock that was forecasted. It is unclear the impact that forecast running time has on lead times\nfor implementation. In the case of Typhoon Ursula (Phanfone) in 2019, the trigger was reached\nonly 12 hours prior to landfall for which no humanitarian action could be planned.\n● Recommendation: In the implementation plan, more clarity is required on potential\noperational impact of long lead times, especially with 100% weightage of model output\nfor trigger activation. The effect of different lead times is unclear for the implementation.\nTo quote one of the documents: 'It takes several hours for the forecast to run so the\ninitial conditions are already often outdated'.\nDecision Support\nDecision support concerns the extent to which action based on model output.\n● Recommendation: Clarity is required in the implementation plan about weightage of\nmodel output on trigger activation, i.e., how much of the decision to act depends on the\nmodel output. If this is not 100%, then the other considerations should be described.\n● Recommendation: Given the possibility of a false negative, operational readiness in case\nof model failure should be detailed in the implementation plan.\nStatistical Bias\nStatistical bias occurs when a model or statistic is not representative of the underlying\npopulation. In this model, different input datasets are used to model different typhoon scenarios,\nsocial vulnerability / poverty data is not suciently disaggregated for evaluation, and the relative\nimportance / weightage of the variables in the model is unclear.\n● Recommendation: The model requires clear documentation of the different datasets\nused, particularly the rationale behind parameters used and their disaggregation, e.g.,\npoverty index. Discrepancies on this front exist between the model card and\nimplementation plan, and the model would benet from their harmonisation. It would\nalso be useful to include these in an overview of the model development process, i.e., the\nrelative weighting and importance of these variables, and how the model changes when\nthey change.\nLack of Transparency\nThe model is open source and has undergone technical review but is missing some\ndocumentation.\n● Recommendation: The model would benet from better documentation of the modelling\nprocess, rationale for the algorithm selection, its tness for purpose, inclusion/ exclusion\ncriteria for variables, etc.\nSystemic Bias\nSystemic bias is the inherent tendency of a process to support specic outcomes. In this mode,\nsocial vulnerability and poverty data are not substantially disaggregated. The move from 'common\ndataset' to 'composite dataset' involved ranking of variables.\n● Recommendation: Clarity, rationale and disaggregation of parameters like social\nvulnerability and poverty would be benecial. Clarity required in relative weights of\nvariables when ranking."

This guidance note deals with sensitive personal and non-personal data.\n2 Roepstorff, K., Faltas, C. and Hövelmann, S., 2020.

Some of these requests relate to sensitive information and data which needs to\nbe protected in order to mitigate risk.\n• Common objectives for data sharing with donors include: (i) situational awareness and\nprogramme design; (ii) accountability and transparency; and (iii) legal, regulatory, and policy\nrequirements.\n• Common constraints related to sharing data with donors include: (i) lack of regulatory framework\nfor responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data; (ii) capacity gaps; and (iii) purpose\nlimitation.\n• Donors and humanitarian organizations can take the following steps to minimize risks while\nmaximizing benefits when sharing sensitive data: (i) reviewing and clarifying the formal or\ninformal frameworks that govern the collection and sharing of disaggregated data; (ii) formalizing\nand standardising requests for sensitive data; (iii) investing in data management capacities of\nstaff and organisations; and (iv) adopting common principles for donor data management.\nINTRODUCTION\nDonors have an important role in the humanitarian data ecosystem, both as drivers of increased data\ncollection and analysis, and as direct users of data. This is not a new phenomenon; the need for\naccountability and transparency in the use of donor funding is broadly understood and respected. However,\nin recent years, donors have begun requesting data that can be sensitive. This includes personal data about\nbeneficiaries and various forms of disaggregated data, such as household-level survey results and data\nabout the delivery of assistance disaggregated by demographic and/or group dimensions (e.g. ethnicity,\nprotection group, etc.).1\nConcerns around requests for such data have led donors and humanitarian organizations to place more\nemphasis on identifying strategies for data responsibility: the safe, ethical and effective management\nof data. Data responsibility requires donors and humanitarian organizations to take actions that help\nminimize risks while maximizing benefits of data. This is particularly challenging in cases where donors\nrequest sensitive data. For example, the screening of aid recipients, which is often used to justify requests\nfor personal data, is not only difficult to practically implement, but also highly problematic in terms of\nprincipled aid.2\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 2\n3\n Non-personal data is defined as data which was initially personal data, but later made anonymous, such as data about the people affected by the\n humanitarian situation and their needs, the threats and vulnerabilities they face, and their capacities (adapted from Regulation (EU)\n 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the\n European Union).\n4\n See the Working Draft OCHA Guidelines for Data Responsibility and the ICRC Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action.\n5\n Read more about the virtual dialogue in this Wilton Park Report.\n6 Willits-King, B. and Spencer, A., 2020. Responsible data-sharing with donors: accountability, transparency and data protection in principled\n humanitarian action.\n7\n At the time of writing, only USAID and GIZ had publicly available guidelines on responsible data sharing. See USAID, 2019. Considerations for using\n data responsibly at USAID and GIZ, 2018. GIZ’s Responsible Data Principles.\n8 Willits-King, B. and Spencer, A., 2020. Responsible data-sharing with donors: accountability, transparency and data protection in principled\n humanitarian action.\nIn addition, sharing seemingly innocuous data such as aggregated survey results can place already\nvulnerable people and communities at greater risk. What may be initially considered non-personal data3\ncan allow for re-identification of individuals, communities and demographic groups. Re-identification\noccurs when data can be traced back or linked to an individual(s) or group(s) of individuals because it is not\nadequately anonymized. This can result in a violation of data protection, privacy and other human rights\nand can allow for targeting of individuals or groups with violence or other forms of harm.4\nMany donors and humanitarian actors recognize the risks and benefits associated with sharing such\nsensitive data, but the sector has yet to establish a common understanding of how to balance these risks\nand benefits effectively. Recent efforts to address this issue have led to more clarity on current practices,\nas well as on the objectives and constraints of data sharing. In September 2020, the Government of\nSwitzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Office for\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) Centre for Humanitarian Data (the Centre) organized a\nvirtual Wilton Park dialogue to help build common understanding on this issue.5\nThis guidance note synthesizes the outcomes of this dialogue and a related desk review.6\n It describes the\nchallenges around sharing sensitive data with donors and offers initial recommendations for how donors\nand humanitarian organizations can more effectively navigate this area.\nDONOR REQUESTS FOR DATA\nDonors regularly request data from their partners in order to fulfil different obligations and objectives.\nThese requests can be either formal or informal.\n• Formal requests tend to be included in grant agreements in relation to reporting criteria, and are\ntypically based on legal requirements such as compliance with counter-terrorism laws. Such requests\ntend to be negotiated at the outset of a partnership or grant agreement, and are usually made in\nwriting and scheduled in advance.\n• Informal requests concern information or data that typically fall outside of the normal scope  of\nreporting. These ad-hoc requests often carry implicit value, meaning that while they are not\nformally required, delivering this supplementary data is deemed beneficial for an organization’s\nongoing engagement and partnership with a donor. These requests represent a greater dilemma for\nhumanitarian actors.\nFew donors have formal data sharing policies or guidelines in place.7\n There is also a lack of shared\nunderstanding of terminology and of the objectives and risks around data sharing. There are different\ndefinitions and understanding of data-related risks, leading to inconsistent and sometimes contradictory\npractices around sharing potentially sensitive data with donors in a particular context.8\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 3\n9 See NRC's Toolkit for Principled Humanitarian Action; Managing CT Risks.\n10 In order to ensure compliance, donors might request highly disaggregated data to corroborate their due diligence processes, ensuring their partners\n are not engaging with any ‘sanctioned’ person or entity’. See Walker, J., 2020. Compliance Dialogue on Syria-Related Humanitarian Payments.\n ‘Sanctioned persons’ is a general term which may include individuals, terrorist groups, governments as well as companies and other entities of legal\n personality. The EU, for example, has over the years considerably strengthened its legal framework for preventing money laundering and terrorism\n financing in recent years and is constantly enforcing in. See: NGO Voice, 2020. The Impact of EU Sanctions and Restrictive Measures on\n Humanitarian Action.\n11 Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Humanitarian Financing Task Team (HFTT), 2016. Donor Conditions and their implications for\n humanitarian response.\n12 Publish What You Fund, 2020. Data Use Capacity in Protracted Humanitarian Crises.\nCONSTRAINTS FOR DATA SHARING WITH DONORS\nDespite these objectives, data sharing with donors is not without its constraints, which include a lack of\nregulatory frameworks for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data, capacity gaps and lack of\npurpose limitation.\nLack of regulatory frameworks for responsibly managing sensitive non-personal data\nThe sensitivity of personal data is generally well-known and addressed by a variety of policy and regulatory\nframeworks, but the same cannot be said for sensitive non-personal data. Protecting groups and their\ndata remains challenging due to the current gaps in regulation and guidance and the overall lack of\nunderstanding regarding the sensitivity of non-personal data. These data policy gaps increase the risk of\nsensitive data not being stored or protected adequately or shared inadvertently by partners in order to\nsatisfy donors’ requests.\nCapacity gaps\nResponding to ad-hoc data sharing requests from donors can be viewed as an additional burden to\nhumanitarian responders, diverting critical time, resources and focus away from other implementing\nactivities.11 Insufficient funding for data-related capacity development has limited many organizations’\nability to provide their staff with the skills and resources required for managing data responsibly.12 Gaps\nin capacity to fulfil donor requirements might also deter smaller and/or local NGOs from seeking funding,\nundermining localization efforts.13\nOBJECTIVES FOR DATA SHARING WITH DONORS\nThe most commonly identified objectives for donors requesting sensitive data from partners are\nsituational awareness and programme design; accountability and transparency; and legal, regulatory, and\npolicy requirements.\nSituational awareness and programme design\nDonors seek information and data from humanitarian organizations in order to understand and react\nto changes in humanitarian contexts. This allows donors to improve their own programme design and\nevaluation, prevent duplication of assistance, identify information gaps, and ensure appropriate targeting\nof assistance.\nAccountability and transparency\nDonors and humanitarian organizations have an obligation to account for their activities. Data can enable\ndonors to explain and defend funding on foreign aid to taxpayers.\nLegal, regulatory, and policy requirements\nDonors are subject to certain national and international legal requirements, including political, legal and\nstatutory requirements related to counter-terrorism, migration and law enforcement. In many cases,\ndonors might want to use data to verify their compliance with these different requirements. Some donors\ninclude counterterrorism clauses in their grant agreements, which are intended to ensure that their funds\nare not used to benefit designated terrorist groups.9\n Similarly, donors might include clauses to cover antibribery, anti-fraud and anti-corruption measures.10\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 4\n14 ICRC, 2020. Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action.\n15 Examples include the Good Humanitarian Donorship Initiative and the Grand Bargain.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nIn view of the objectives and constraints detailed above, the Centre, the Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG)\nat ODI, the ICRC, and the Human Security Division of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs\nrecommend that donors and humanitarian organizations take the following steps to minimize risks while\nmaximizing benefits when sharing sensitive data:\n• Reviewing and clarifying the formal or informal frameworks that govern the collection and\nsharing of disaggregated data\nDonors and partners should examine the official, formal requirements and ad-hoc, informal\nrequirements of data sharing, and analyse partner and donor staff interpret whether requirements\ncorrectly and consistently. They should assess whether there are implicit conditionalities between the\nwillingness to share disaggregated data and the ability of different organizations to access and sustain\nfunding from donors.\n• Formalizing and standardizing requests for sensitive data\nWhen sensitive data is required to meet a mutually agreed objective, donors should formalize and\nstandardize their requests for such data. Requests should be made in writing and should specify\nwhich data is requested, the format desired, and the intended use of the data. Donors should only\nrequest the information required to meet the specified purpose for which it is being requested and\nshould indicate a timeline for destruction of the data. Humanitarian organisations should document\nall requests for data and ensure consistency in responding to these requests over time.\n• Investing in data management capacities of staff and organizations\nDonors and humanitarian organizations should identify opportunities to invest in building data\nmanagement expertise especially for non-technical staff. The donor community is uniquely positioned\nto encourage data responsibility by providing additional resources for training and capacity building.\n• Adopting common principles for donor data management\nThe sector already has a range of principles and commitments to inform different aspects of\nhumanitarian donorship.15 However, these do not sufficiently address concerns related to data\nresponsibility. Donors and partners should engage in the development of common principles and\nguidelines for donor data sharing to fill this gap. The Humanitarian Data and Trust Initiative, co-led\nby the Government of Switzerland, the ICRC, and the Centre, offers a platform to facilitate this process\nas part of its ongoing work to build trust through dialogue.\nOrganizations are encouraged to share their experience in responsible data sharing with donors with the\nCentre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.\nPurpose limitation\nThe principle of purpose limitation requires that data is only collected for specified, explicit and legitimate\npurposes, and that it not be processed further in a manner that would be incompatible with those\npurposes.14 Even when donors specify legitimate reasons for requesting data in-line with the original\npurposes for which the data was collected (e.g. the delivery of humanitarian assistance), it can be difficult\nto ensure that the data will not be used for other purposes once shared. Data used out of context and for\npurposes that are not known at the time of sharing, or retained past the intended retention for a defined\npurpose represents a violation, even if unintended, of the data subjects’ rights.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA DECEMBER 2020 5\nThis project is co-funded\nby the European Union\nThis document covers humanitarian aid activities implemented with the financial assistance of the\nEuropean Union. The views expressed herein should not be taken, in any way, to reflect the official opinion\nof the European Union, and the European Commission is not responsible for any use that may be made of\nthe information it contains.\nCOLLABORATORS: THE HUMANITARIAN POLICY GROUP AT ODI; INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS;\nAND THE HUMAN SECURITY DIVISION, SWISS FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.\nThe Centre for Humanitarian Data ('the Center'), together with key partners, is publishing a series of eight\nguidance notes on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action over the course of 2019 and 2020. The Guidance\nNote series follows the publication of the OCHA Data Responsibility Guidelines in March 2019. Through\nthe series, the Centre aims to provide additional guidance on specific issues, processes and tools for data\nresponsibility in practice.

THE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 1\nWHAT IS A DATA INCIDENT IN HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE?\nIn the humanitarian sector, data incidents are events involving the management of data that have caused\nharm or have the potential to cause harm to crisis affected populations, humanitarian organisations\nand their operations, and other individuals or groups. These events can exploit or exacerbate existing\nvulnerabilities.1\n In some cases, they may also create new vulnerabilities that can increase the risk of future\ndata incidents.\nHumanitarians have not had a common understanding of what comprises a data incident, nor is there\na minimum technical standard for how these incidents should be prevented and managed. How the\nhumanitarian sector develops tools and implements procedures for data incident management will play\na significant role in the evolution of the ethical, human rights, technical, and professional standards of\nhumanitarian operations.\n1 “A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by\n a threat source.” NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\nGUIDANCE NOTE SERIES\nDATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION\nDATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n• Humanitarian data incidents are events involving the management of data that have caused\nharm or have the potential to cause harm to crisis-affected people, organizations and their\noperations, and other individuals or groups.\n• Examples of humanitarian data incidents include physical breaches of infrastructure,\nunauthorised disclosure of data, and the use of beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes,\namong others.\n• A data incident has four aspects: (i) a threat source, (ii) a threat event, (iii) a vulnerability and (iv)\nan adverse impact.\n• There are five steps to responding to data incidents: (i) notification, (ii) classification, (iii)\ntreatment, and (iv) closure of the incident, as well as (v) learning.\n“If aid actors digitize more of their data and communications, they urgently\n need to increase their digital security efforts. Though some actors are\n developing promising protective tools, aid organizations overall might be\n well advised to listen to a quote from IT-security circles: ‘There are two\n types of organizations: those who have been hacked, and those who will be.”\n- Rahel Dette, Do No Digital Harm: Mitigating Technology Risk in Humanitarian Contexts\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 2\nDEFINITIONS AND FRAMEWORKS FOR UNDERSTANDING DATA INCIDENTS\nGovernments and the private sector have developed definitions and frameworks for understanding data\nincidents that serve as helpful references for the humanitarian sector.\n• The International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) in ISO Standard 27000 defines a ‘critical\nincident’ as “a single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information security events that have a\nsignificant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security.”2\n• The United States Department of Commerce National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)\ndefines an adverse event involving a ‘cyber threat’ as “[a]n event or condition that has the potential\nfor causing asset loss and the undesirable consequences or impact from such loss.”3\n• Mahmood Sher-Jan of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) identifies three\nadditional categories of events that expand upon the NIST definition of adverse events. These are, in\norder of escalating severity: security incidents; privacy incidents; and data breaches.4\n2 International Organization for Standardization, ISO/IEC 27000:2018.\n3 NIST Computer Security Resource Center Glossary.\n4 IAPP, Is It an Incident or a Breach, How to Tell and Why It Matters, Mahmoud Sher-Jan (February 2017).\n5 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nHumanitarian data incidents may include physical breaches of infrastructure, unauthorised disclosure of\ndata, and the use of ‘anonymised’ beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes, among others. Data\nincidents can also occur without technical infrastructure being compromised in any way. The legitimate\ncollection, use, and sharing of data by humanitarians can still have operational implications that may\nconstitute a data incident in cases where rumors, cultural sensitivities, political dynamics, and other\nfactors lead to adverse effects linked to the data.\nExamples of possible humanitarian data incidents\nA data incident has four factors: a threat source, a threat event, a vulnerability and an adverse impact.5\nBelow are two types of hypothetical data incidents that could occur in humanitarian contexts.\nThe first scenario is a typical data breach incident situated in the context of an armed conflict. The\nsecond is an example of the type of vulnerabilities that can initiate data incidents unique to the\nhumanitarian sector.\n1. Unauthorized access to data occurs [impact] due to armed actors [source] raiding a facility and\nseizing hard-drives containing beneficiary data [event]. The hard-drives were unencrypted\n[vulnerability].\n2. Absence of guidance limiting data collection for a specific purpose [vulnerability] leads to staff\ncollecting data about the marital status of pregnant women [source]. A data breach [event] later\noccurs, resulting in an increased chance of physical violence [impact] against unwed pregnant\nbeneficiaries.\nThese scenarios demonstrate how to think about identifying causal chains that may create contextspecific data incidents. \nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 3\n6 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nRISK MODELS\nThe figure below presents a generic risk model with risk factors that organizations can use to understand\nhow a data incident may occur. A threat event exploits an existing vulnerability that is either magnified by\npredisposing conditions or mitigated by security controls already in place. This causes adverse impacts that\nproduce organizational risk, which can include risks for the organization and for affected people.\nFigure 1. “Generic Risk Model with Key Risk Factors”. Source: NIST Special Publication\n800-30 pg. 126\nThe figure below presents one example of how this generic risk model could be adapted to the\nhumanitarian sector.\nFigure 2. Risk Model with Key Risk Factors adapted to a humanitarian context.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 4\nHumanitarian organizations can develop their own specific risk models for data incident management\nincorporating these factors. The nature of these risk factors and how they come together to constitute a\ndata incident will vary from one organization to another and should be adapted to specific operational\nrealities.\nSTEPS IN DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nAfter clearly defining what constitutes a data incident, organizations can develop Standard Operating\nProcedures (SOPs) for data incident management.\nData incident management SOPs should include the following 5 steps: 1) notification, 2) classification;\n3) treatment; 4) closure; and 5) knowledge base.7\n7 The Centre for Humanitarian Data provides several sources of guidance that can inform the development of Data Incident Management SOPs on\n the Data Responsibility page.\n8 How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16, Antonio Jose Segovia, (October 2015.).\n9 For humanitarian organizations, an example of such a classification is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of\n Patient Safety, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\n10 WHO, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\nFigure 3: Five steps in the treatment of security incidents (Source: How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16,\nAntonio Jose Segovia8\nThe application of these steps in an organization can look as follows:\n1. Notification of the incident: A person detects an incident and notifies relevant colleagues according\nto the communication procedures of the organization (usually an email, a phone call, a software tool,\netc.). A notification should contain, if possible, a description of the key risk factors involved in the\nincident: source, event, vulnerability and impact.\n2. Classification of the incident: The recipient of the notification classifies the incident based on it’s\nimpact (high, medium or low) and the urgency of treatment (high, medium or low).9\n Managing risk\nbegins with classifying all incidents, whether or not tangible harm actually results from them.10\n3. Treatment of the incident: A technical expert decides on the necessary measures to treat the incident\nonce the incident has been classified and the time for treatment has been agreed.\n4. Closure of the incident: All information generated during the treatment is recorded and the person\nwho first sent notification of the incident is informed that the incident is closed.\n5. Knowledge base: All information generated during the treatment of the incident is used to inform and\ntrain colleagues and as reference material for future similar incidents.\nHumanitarian organizations can base their SOPs on this 5-step model, describing how each step should\ntake place within their organization. This should include the functions/roles and teams within an\norganization that are responsible at each stage of the process. These steps should be incorporated into\nor extended from existing incident response protocols (e.g. security incident management related to\nhumanitarian access).\nIn a given response context, organizations should also work to integrate any joint incident management\nprocedures into existing coordination structures, such as the clusters and mechanisms for inter- and\nintra-cluster coordination.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 5\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT IN\nHUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS\nIntroducing or improving data incident management in humanitarian operations is critical to more\nresponsible data practice in the sector. The Centre for Humanitarian Data recommends that organizations\nfocus on the following areas:\n1. Establish a common understanding of data incident management\nUse a risk model to understand the causal chain that can lead to data incidents for specific offices and\nsystems. Identify key threat actors and vulnerabilities for offices and systems and understand existing\nsecurity controls and their effectiveness. Finally, map existing data incident management capacity\nand determine whether it is positioned appropriately. Once clear definitions and processes are\narticulated, invest in staff awareness and support a culture of open dialogue about incidents, in which\nproactive reporting and management of incidents is incentivized, not punished.\n2. Strengthen data incident management capacity\nTake measures to put in place security controls to mitigate the risk of data incidents, and share best\npractice with partners. Build on existing work in the sector to fill governance gaps which can create\nvulnerabilities for your organization. Engage with organizational partners to set up information\nchannels around data incidents. Share known vulnerabilities in a controlled manner with trusted\ncounterparts for cross-organizational learning.\n3. Support continuous learning\nSupport learning and development of improved data incident management practices by organizing\ntraining and drills based on scenarios likely to occur in different operational settings. These exercises\nshould occur regularly and may even involve multiple organizations training and drilling together. In\naddition, document actual data incidents as cases for internal knowledge development.\nOrganizations are encouraged to share their experience in the development of data incident management\nwith the Centre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.\nThis project is co-funded\nby the European Union\nThis document covers humanitarian aid activities implemented with the financial assistance of the\nEuropean Union. The views expressed herein should not be taken, in any way, to reflect the official opinion\nof the European Union, and the European Commission is not responsible for any use that may be made of\nthe information it contains.\nCOLLABORATORS: YALE UNIVERSITY, JACKSON INSTITUTE OF GLOBAL AFFAIRS.\nThe Centre for Humanitarian Data (‘the Centre’), together with key partners, is publishing a series of eight\nguidance notes on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action over the course of 2019 and 2020. The Guidance\nNote series follows the publication of the OCHA Data Responsibility Guidelines in March 2019. Through\nthe series, the Centre aims to provide additional guidance on specific issues, processes and tools for data\nresponsibility in practice. This series is made possible with the generous support of the Directorate-General for\nEuropean Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO)."

These events can exploit or exacerbate existing\nvulnerabilities.1\n In some cases, they may also create new vulnerabilities that can increase the risk of future\ndata incidents.\nHumanitarians have not had a common understanding of what comprises a data incident, nor is there\na minimum technical standard for how these incidents should be prevented and managed. How the\nhumanitarian sector develops tools and implements procedures for data incident management will play\na significant role in the evolution of the ethical, human rights, technical, and professional standards of\nhumanitarian operations.\n1 “A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by\n a threat source.” NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA\nGUIDANCE NOTE SERIES\nDATA RESPONSIBILITY IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION\nDATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nKEY TAKEAWAYS:\n• Humanitarian data incidents are events involving the management of data that have caused\nharm or have the potential to cause harm to crisis-affected people, organizations and their\noperations, and other individuals or groups.\n• Examples of humanitarian data incidents include physical breaches of infrastructure,\nunauthorised disclosure of data, and the use of beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes,\namong others.\n• A data incident has four aspects: (i) a threat source, (ii) a threat event, (iii) a vulnerability and (iv)\nan adverse impact.\n• There are five steps to responding to data incidents: (i) notification, (ii) classification, (iii)\ntreatment, and (iv) closure of the incident, as well as (v) learning.\n“If aid actors digitize more of their data and communications, they urgently\n need to increase their digital security efforts. Though some actors are\n developing promising protective tools, aid organizations overall might be\n well advised to listen to a quote from IT-security circles: ‘There are two\n types of organizations: those who have been hacked, and those who will be.”\n- Rahel Dette, Do No Digital Harm: Mitigating Technology Risk in Humanitarian Contexts\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 2\nDEFINITIONS AND FRAMEWORKS FOR UNDERSTANDING DATA INCIDENTS\nGovernments and the private sector have developed definitions and frameworks for understanding data\nincidents that serve as helpful references for the humanitarian sector.\n• The International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) in ISO Standard 27000 defines a ‘critical\nincident’ as “a single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information security events that have a\nsignificant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security.”2\n• The United States Department of Commerce National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)\ndefines an adverse event involving a ‘cyber threat’ as “[a]n event or condition that has the potential\nfor causing asset loss and the undesirable consequences or impact from such loss.”3\n• Mahmood Sher-Jan of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) identifies three\nadditional categories of events that expand upon the NIST definition of adverse events. These are, in\norder of escalating severity: security incidents; privacy incidents; and data breaches.4\n2 International Organization for Standardization, ISO/IEC 27000:2018.\n3 NIST Computer Security Resource Center Glossary.\n4 IAPP, Is It an Incident or a Breach, How to Tell and Why It Matters, Mahmoud Sher-Jan (February 2017).\n5 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nHumanitarian data incidents may include physical breaches of infrastructure, unauthorised disclosure of\ndata, and the use of ‘anonymised’ beneficiary data for non-humanitarian purposes, among others. Data\nincidents can also occur without technical infrastructure being compromised in any way. The legitimate\ncollection, use, and sharing of data by humanitarians can still have operational implications that may\nconstitute a data incident in cases where rumors, cultural sensitivities, political dynamics, and other\nfactors lead to adverse effects linked to the data.\nExamples of possible humanitarian data incidents\nA data incident has four factors: a threat source, a threat event, a vulnerability and an adverse impact.5\nBelow are two types of hypothetical data incidents that could occur in humanitarian contexts.\nThe first scenario is a typical data breach incident situated in the context of an armed conflict. The\nsecond is an example of the type of vulnerabilities that can initiate data incidents unique to the\nhumanitarian sector.\n1. Unauthorized access to data occurs [impact] due to armed actors [source] raiding a facility and\nseizing hard-drives containing beneficiary data [event]. The hard-drives were unencrypted\n[vulnerability].\n2. Absence of guidance limiting data collection for a specific purpose [vulnerability] leads to staff\ncollecting data about the marital status of pregnant women [source]. A data breach [event] later\noccurs, resulting in an increased chance of physical violence [impact] against unwed pregnant\nbeneficiaries.\nThese scenarios demonstrate how to think about identifying causal chains that may create contextspecific data incidents. \nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 3\n6 NIST Special Publication 800-30 Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.\nRISK MODELS\nThe figure below presents a generic risk model with risk factors that organizations can use to understand\nhow a data incident may occur. A threat event exploits an existing vulnerability that is either magnified by\npredisposing conditions or mitigated by security controls already in place. This causes adverse impacts that\nproduce organizational risk, which can include risks for the organization and for affected people.\nFigure 1. “Generic Risk Model with Key Risk Factors”. Source: NIST Special Publication\n800-30 pg. 126\nThe figure below presents one example of how this generic risk model could be adapted to the\nhumanitarian sector.\nFigure 2. Risk Model with Key Risk Factors adapted to a humanitarian context.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 4\nHumanitarian organizations can develop their own specific risk models for data incident management\nincorporating these factors. The nature of these risk factors and how they come together to constitute a\ndata incident will vary from one organization to another and should be adapted to specific operational\nrealities.\nSTEPS IN DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT\nAfter clearly defining what constitutes a data incident, organizations can develop Standard Operating\nProcedures (SOPs) for data incident management.\nData incident management SOPs should include the following 5 steps: 1) notification, 2) classification;\n3) treatment; 4) closure; and 5) knowledge base.7\n7 The Centre for Humanitarian Data provides several sources of guidance that can inform the development of Data Incident Management SOPs on\n the Data Responsibility page.\n8 How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16, Antonio Jose Segovia, (October 2015.).\n9 For humanitarian organizations, an example of such a classification is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of\n Patient Safety, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\n10 WHO, Conceptual Framework for the International Classification of Patient Safety.\nFigure 3: Five steps in the treatment of security incidents (Source: How to handle incidents according to ISO 27001 A.16,\nAntonio Jose Segovia8\nThe application of these steps in an organization can look as follows:\n1. Notification of the incident: A person detects an incident and notifies relevant colleagues according\nto the communication procedures of the organization (usually an email, a phone call, a software tool,\netc.). A notification should contain, if possible, a description of the key risk factors involved in the\nincident: source, event, vulnerability and impact.\n2. Classification of the incident: The recipient of the notification classifies the incident based on it’s\nimpact (high, medium or low) and the urgency of treatment (high, medium or low).9\n Managing risk\nbegins with classifying all incidents, whether or not tangible harm actually results from them.10\n3. Treatment of the incident: A technical expert decides on the necessary measures to treat the incident\nonce the incident has been classified and the time for treatment has been agreed.\n4. Closure of the incident: All information generated during the treatment is recorded and the person\nwho first sent notification of the incident is informed that the incident is closed.\n5. Knowledge base: All information generated during the treatment of the incident is used to inform and\ntrain colleagues and as reference material for future similar incidents.\nHumanitarian organizations can base their SOPs on this 5-step model, describing how each step should\ntake place within their organization. This should include the functions/roles and teams within an\norganization that are responsible at each stage of the process. These steps should be incorporated into\nor extended from existing incident response protocols (e.g. security incident management related to\nhumanitarian access).\nIn a given response context, organizations should also work to integrate any joint incident management\nprocedures into existing coordination structures, such as the clusters and mechanisms for inter- and\nintra-cluster coordination.\nTHE CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA AUGUST 2019 5\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT IN\nHUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS\nIntroducing or improving data incident management in humanitarian operations is critical to more\nresponsible data practice in the sector. The Centre for Humanitarian Data recommends that organizations\nfocus on the following areas:\n1. Establish a common understanding of data incident management\nUse a risk model to understand the causal chain that can lead to data incidents for specific offices and\nsystems. Identify key threat actors and vulnerabilities for offices and systems and understand existing\nsecurity controls and their effectiveness. Finally, map existing data incident management capacity\nand determine whether it is positioned appropriately. Once clear definitions and processes are\narticulated, invest in staff awareness and support a culture of open dialogue about incidents, in which\nproactive reporting and management of incidents is incentivized, not punished.\n2. Strengthen data incident management capacity\nTake measures to put in place security controls to mitigate the risk of data incidents, and share best\npractice with partners. Build on existing work in the sector to fill governance gaps which can create\nvulnerabilities for your organization. Engage with organizational partners to set up information\nchannels around data incidents. Share known vulnerabilities in a controlled manner with trusted\ncounterparts for cross-organizational learning.\n3. Support continuous learning\nSupport learning and development of improved data incident management practices by organizing\ntraining and drills based on scenarios likely to occur in different operational settings. These exercises\nshould occur regularly and may even involve multiple organizations training and drilling together. In\naddition, document actual data incidents as cases for internal knowledge development.\nOrganizations are encouraged to share their experience in the development of data incident management\nwith the Centre for Humanitarian Data via centrehumdata@un.org.\nThis project is co-funded\nby the European Union\nThis document covers humanitarian aid activities implemented with the financial assistance of the\nEuropean Union.

It was completed by\nOCHA in June 2022 and updated in October 2022.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix presents the outcomes of the technical review and was\ncompleted by Mohammad Shamsudduha, Associate Professor in Humanitarian Science\nat the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London, in December\n2022.\n● The Implementation Plan summarizes the concrete actions that the trigger mechanism\nwill inform and was developed by OCHA in October 2022.\n● The Ethical Matrix identies issues that may come up in the implementation of the\ntrigger mechanism and stakeholders that may be impacted by those issues. The Ethical\nMatrix was completed in January 2023 by Andrea Romaoli Garcia, ITU Topic Driver on\nOpen Code.\nThe sections below provide a summary of the main ndings and recommendations developed in\nthe review.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The intended use of the predictive model is appropriate.\n● The model may not detect localized rainfall shortages, which could lead to the model\nmissing a trigger where it should detect increased drought risk. In addition, crop failure\ndepends on a number of factors other than rainfall, including the use and availability of\ngroundwater for irrigation as well as changes in temperature. The fact that these\nadditional factors are not included in the model should be considered in the\ninterpretation of model outputs.\nModel Development and Documentation\n● The resolution of the spatial coverage of the predictive model is very high at 0.05\ndegrees. The predictive model produces outputs on a monthly basis. The geographic\nscope of the predictive model includes the entire country of Niger. These parameters are\nappropriate for a national-scale model.\n● The spatial resolution of the predictive model at 0.05 degrees is too high given that the\npredictive model is primarily dependent on precipitation variability. Correlation between\nforecasts and observational rainfall data produced by CHIRPS is weak in Maradi and\nNiamey regions, where the irrigation is the highest in the country.\nModel Evaluation\n● The predictive model is evaluated using accuracy, hit rate, miss rate, false positives and\nfalse negatives as parameters. These model evaluation criteria are appropriate for this\npredictive model.\n● A comparison between the predictive model outputs and NextGen forecasts was based\nonly on CHIRPS gridded rainfall data. No detailed information is provided on the\ndownscaling of the forecasts and evaluation of the downscaled technique.\nOperational Readiness\n● Activities and funding are provided on a “no-regrets” basis after a trigger activation.\nActivities and funding are purposefully selected to still be valuable in the absence of a\nshock. The addition of an observational trigger based on SPI is a strength of this\nanticipatory trigger mechanism.\n● The forecast accuracy could be improved if the predictive model is tailored to individual\nareas within Niger.\n● There is little mention of local/national capacity building or strengthening in the process.\n● The performance of the predictive model should be evaluated against the observational\nmodel outputs to better understand the weaknesses in the predictive model.\nStrengthening the predictive model outputs increases the potential impact of the trigger\nmechanism due to the increased lead time.\n● The low or even negative correlation between the predictive model outputs and CHIRPS\nprecipitation in the northern part of Niger should be examined to improve the\nperformance and validity of the predictive model.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nFalse negative activation (non-activation in the presence of a shock)\n● A false negative would deprive the community of timely aid.\n● Recommendation: The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously evaluated\nagainst the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS precipitation data to\nlower the likelihood of false negatives.\nFalse positive activation (activation in the absence of a shock)\n● A false positive would increase the risk of wasted nancial resources. Such error could\nundermine the condence of stakeholders and donors and could lead to discontinuation\nof the trigger mechanism. A false negative primarily impacts other stakeholders,\nincluding local NGOs, the model developers and UN entities, due to the misallocation of\nresources. It also undermines trust in the trigger mechanism.\n● Recommendation: A false positive is more tolerable compared to a false negative, as a\nfalse positive triggers activities and funding that benet the population even in the\nabsence of a shock. The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously\nevaluated against the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS\nprecipitation data to lower the likelihood of false positives.\nIdentity exposure (exposure of individual identities through potential use of additional data\nsources in implementation of the model)\n● Unauthorized access to any personal data used in future implementation of the trigger\nmechanism could cause harm and carries reputational risk.\n● Recommendation: Given that the trigger mechanism does not include the use of any\npersonal data there is little concern that a data breach could result in re-identication. If\nthe implementation of the trigger mechanism evolves over time to include additional\npersonal data, the tools and infrastructure used in implementation should be\nre-evaluated and adjusted as needed to mitigate the risk of identity exposure.\nBias in available data\n● Bias in data availability resulting from gaps in data for different regions in Niger could\naffect the allocation of funding and activities.\n● Recommendation: Determine whether there are gaps resulting in biases in climate data\navailability for Niger in order to prevent unfair allocation of funding and activities.\nFeedback\nThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic, research and\nprivate sector to engage with us on the peer review process.

This guidance series has been developed to help humanitarians to access, analyze and\ninterpret common types of climate and weather data, and to provide a common language for working\nwith meteorological and hydrological services.\n• Observational rainfall data such as CHIRPS or ARC2 captures how much rain has fallen over a\ndefined period of time.\n• The rainfall is measured at weather stations or estimated through satellite or radar imagery.\n• The data can be presented as the total amount of rainfall observed over the period of time,\nor as below, at or above normal conditions.\n• Datasets that combine station data and satellite or radar imagery are the recommended\nsource of data for humanitarian purposes.\n• Observational rainfall data can be analyzed to answer a range of questions, such as:\n• What areas are currently affected by drought, and how severely?\n• What was the duration of the longest dry spell during the past rainy season?\n• How many days of heavy rainfall were there in the week leading up to the floods?\n• Which area received the most rain last month?\n• How often does an area experience dry spells?\n• How does this year’s rainfall compare to previous years?\nKey takeaways\nWhat is observational rainfall data?\nObservational rainfall data captures how much rain fell over a defined period of time,\nranging from an hour to a day. This data can then be used to calculate the total rainfall for\ndifferent time periods, such as 5 days (pentad), 10 days (dekad), a week, a month or a season.\nObservational rainfall datasets can go back decades and have broad geographic coverage,\nenabling historical trend analysis and comparisons.\nObservational rainfall data is produced by measuring the amount of rainfall at precise\nlocations, which are called measuring stations or gauges (e.g., the stars in Figure 1 below).\nStation data is typically obtained from national or regional meteorological services and should\nonly be used in accordance with their guidance. Some of the advantages of station data are\nthat it is accurate at the specific locations, it is collected frequently and it has been collected\nover the long-term, allowing for trend analysis. On the other hand, station data is only\navailable for specific locations and is subject to bias due to wind, evaporation, and changes in\nmeasurement devices. Contact the local or regional meteorological services to learn whether\nstation data is available, where the stations are located, how often the data is updated, and\nwhether historical records are available.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 3\nRainfall can also be estimated using satellite or radar images that cover areas several square\nkilometers wide (e.g., the squares in Figure 1 below). Satellite imagery is typically obtained\nby global providers and academic or research centers (e.g., the Climate Hazards Center) who\nshare their derived estimates publicly. Satellite or radar images are useful for understanding\npatterns over larger geographic areas. Some of the advantages of satellite data are that it has\nextensive geographic coverage, including in remote and inaccessible areas, and that it is shared\nin a continuous and consistent way. On the other hand, satellite measurements are subject to\nerrors due to cloud contamination, and the data has a shorter historical record.\nFigure 1. Weather Stations in Zambia (red stars). The grid superimposed onto the map consists of individual\nboxes, each of which corresponds to a particular location where satellite weather measurements are\nconducted by certain providers. In this case, the grid is the one used by the ARC2 dataset (see below). The\nsize of each box is 0.1 degree (about 11 km at the equator).\nIn order to help correct for the inaccuracies and errors that are present in the two types of data\nand take advantage of their individual strengths, research institutions have produced rainfall\ndatasets that combine station and satellite/radar observations. Datasets that combine these\nobservations are the recommended source of data for humanitarian purposes.\nObservational precipitation data can be presented in various formats, each providing unique\ninsights into precipitation patterns. The most common representation is through absolute\nvalues, which reflect the actual amount of precipitation observed at a specific location and time,\ntypically measured in millimeters. Precipitation averages, which are calculated from historical\nrecords over a period of typically at least 10 years, can be produced for a specific location,\nseason, or year. A precipitation anomaly represents the deviation from the expected or average\nprecipitation over a particular period, which can be expressed as a difference in millimeters\nor as a percentage. The purpose of the analysis determines the most useful representation.\nAbsolute values provide insight into the total precipitation received at a location, while\nanomalies and averages help to understand long-term trends, including dry or wet periods,\nwhich is valuable for assessing drought or excessive rainfall conditions severity.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 4\n1 https://data.humdata.org/organization/wfp?q=chirps\n2 The dataset spans the latitude range 50°S-50°N, and all longitudes.\n3 CHIRPS produces a preliminary version of their estimates with a latency of two days. The final version is published in the third week of the\n following month.\nCommon sources of observational rainfall data\nAmong the many sources of data available, we introduce here two common sources of\nobservational rainfall data, both of which combine station and satellite data: CHIRPS and ARC2.\nCHIRPS refers to the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data and is\nproduced by scientists from the US Geological Survey and the Climate Hazards Center at the\nUniversity of Santa Barbara. ARC2 refers to Africa Rainfall Climatology Version 2 and it is\nproduced by The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center\nfor the Famine Early Warning System. You can access the data directly from these providers, or\nuse the tabular CHIRPS datasets that provides pre-computed rainfall metrics at admin2 and is\navailable on HDX.1\nCOMPARISON OF CHIRPS AND ARC2 OBSERVATIONAL RAINFALL DATA\nSource CHIRPS ARC2\nFormat Raster Raster\nGeographical coverage Global (quasi2) Africa\nSpatial granularity\n(also referred to as spatial\nresolution)\n0.05 degree (5.5 km at the equator) 0.1 degree (11 km at the equator)\nTemporal granularity\n(aso referred to as temporal\nresolution)\nDaily rainfall3 Daily rainfall\nHistorical coverage 1981 - today 1983 - today\nPublication Every month, around the third week of\nthe following month\nEvery day, with a 2-day lag\nMost common uses • Monthly, seasonal, or yearly rainfall\nmonitoring\n• Included in other tools including\nthose used for drought monitoring and\nFEWS NET assessments\n• Trend analysis across years\n• Near real-time monitoring in Africa\n• Year-to-year comparisons in Africa\nQuestions to answer with observational rainfall data\nObservational rainfall data can be used to answer a number of questions and inform decision\nmaking in humanitarian operations. Examples include:\n• How much rain fell in the past x days/weeks/months? Observational rainfall datasets\nprovide data on the total amount of rainfall for an area over a discrete period of time, which\ncan be aggregated and used to calculate rainfall over different time intervals. \nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 5\n• Was the rainfall last month above or below normal? And by how much? Observational\nrainfall data goes back decades and can therefore be used to determine whether rainfall for\na month or a season is above, at or below the historical average.\n• Were there more rainy days this month than last month? Observational rainfall data is\navailable for each day and can be used to determine if it rained or not on a given day and to\ncount the number of dry or wet days during a specific period of time.\n• How many dry spells were there during the past rainy season? How long was the\nlongest dry spell and the heaviest rain streak this past rainy season? Observational\nrainfall data can be used to detect the occurrence, location and duration of dry spells and\nprolonged periods of heavy rain.\n• How often in the past decade were more than x millimeters of rainfall measured?\nObservational rainfall data provides daily rainfall totals in millimeters and can be used to\nassess how often an area received rain above or below a given threshold.\n• Which region received the most rain last month? Observational rainfall data can be\naggregated to provide rainfall totals for larger geographic areas and then used to compare\nrain for that area.\nObservational rainfall data cannot answer the following questions:\n• How much will it rain during a period of time in the future? Observational rainfall data is\nreferred to as observational because it describes what happened in the past. It does not tell\nyou anything about future rainfall.\n• Is a severe flooding event about to occur? Are we going through a severe drought?\nObservational rainfall data does not provide sufficient information to inform you about the\nrisk of flooding in the near future or how severe a drought is likely to be. This is because\nfloods and droughts are complex phenomena caused by several interacting factors and they\ncannot be explained exclusively by the amount of precipitation.\n• How much rainfall from a given period of time in the past was due to specific tropical\nstorm or typhoon? It is hard to differentiate between the amount of rain caused by\naverage atmospheric conditions and the amount of rain induced by a specific atmospheric\nphenomenon. As a result, using observational rainfall data alone, it is not possible to say how\nmuch rainfall is due strictly to a tropical storm or typhoon. More data is needed to infer the\norigin of a heavy rainfall event.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 6\n4 Learn more: https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps\n5 Learn more here: https://wiki.chc.ucsb.edu/CHIRPS_FAQ#What_is_the_spatial_density_of_station_data_used_in_CHIRPS.3F\nCommon limitations with observations rainfall data\nOnce you have identified how you want to use the data, it is important to bear in mind some\ncommon limitations when conducting your analysis.\n1. Low-amount or short-duration rainfall may be underreported in certain geographical\nterrains or during extreme precipitation events.4 Gauges are constantly being improved\nto reduce error and datasets that combine station and satellite/radar data are best at\ncorrecting for these limitations. However, it is still important to keep these limitations in\nmind, especially when doing analysis that is looking at meteorological events that involve\nlow-amount or short-duration rainfall, such as dry spells.\n2. There are fewer gauge stations in rural areas and certain developing countries, which\nmeans that observational rainfall data is often less accurate in these locations. Fewer gauge\nstations means that there are fewer measurements for that geographic area, resulting in\na less complete picture of what is happening on the ground. Differences in the amount of\nrainfall received in two locations might be missed if there are not stations to capture rainfall\nin both locations.5\n3. Observational rainfall data is usually provided as a raster dataset, where the geographic\narea is represented by a contiguous grid of cells, or pixels. Each cell represents a discrete\narea of land, and has a value associated with it but the cells do not neatly fit within\nadministrative boundaries. Calculating rainfall for an administrative area requires an\naggregation. The choice of the aggregation method (average, maximum, total etc.) as well\nas the choice of which cells to include within a given administrative division (all cells fully\nincluded, or all cells touched etc.) will impact the results. This is especially true for lower\nadministrative divisions. As a result, adding together the total rainfall for all the districts in a\nregion may not equal the total rainfall calculated for the region.\n4. If using station data, it is important to bear in mind that stations are easily subject to\ndeterioration and require frequent maintenance, which may affect their accuracy. For\nthis reason, calculating temporal averages, anomalies or trends over long periods of time\nshould be performed with care. When possible, verify with the provider the adequacy of\nthe measurements over long periods of time. This limitation does not apply to CHIRPS and\nARC2 datasets, which have been calibrated and combined with satellite observations by\nclimate institutions.\n5. For station data, differences exist between measuring instruments and quality of their\nmeasurements. This may heavily affect comparisons between different locations. Therefore,\nwhen performing geographical averages, it is preferable to use radar data, satellite data or\nobservational datasets already calibrated by institutions or universities such as CHIRPS or\nARC2.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 7\nResources\n• Learn more about the CHIRPS6 and ARC27 observational datasets and/or download data\ndirectly from the providers.\n• CHIRPS on HDX8: Download pre-computed tabular data (CSV format) on precipitation totals,\naverages, anomalies per administrative region.\n• ARC29: Download 1-month or 10-day cumulative precipitation totals (raster, tabular, image\ndata).\n• OCHA AnticiPy10: Download raster (NetCDF) data directly from CHIRPS and ARC2 using a\nPython library.\n6 https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps\n7 https://www.icpac.net/data-center/arc2/\n8 https://data.humdata.org/dataset?q=CHIRPS\n9 https://gmes.icpac.net/data-center/arc2-rfe\n10 https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/ocha-anticipy\n11 https://centre.humdata.org/\n12 https://www.climate.columbia.edu/\n13 https://iri.columbia.edu/\n14 https://www.knmi.nl/over-het-knmi/about\nThis guidance was developed by the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data11 with input from\nColumbia University Climate School12 International Research Institute for Climate and Society13,\nthe Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute14, and the Earth Observation Unit of the Research,\nAssessment and Monitoring division of the World Food Programme."

Background\nThis document summarizes the documentation and ndings developed in the peer review of the\nAnticipatory Action Trigger for Drought in Niger. The trigger mechanism was designed for an\nanticipatory action framework coordinated by OCHA. The goal of the trigger mechanism is to\ndetect increased drought risk in Niger and trigger the release of funds from the Central\nEmergency Response Fund in anticipation of drought-related humanitarian needs. The release\nof funds can be triggered from six months ahead of the rainy season (which runs from July\nthrough September) until one month into the season. The trigger mechanism includes a\npredictive model that uses seasonal precipitation forecasts and an observational model that\nuses the Standardized Precipitation Index.\nThe review was conducted between May 2022 and January 2023.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nThe documentation describing the model and its application, as well as the outcomes of the\nreview process, are available through the following links:\n● The Model Card describes version 1 of the trigger mechanism. It was completed by\nOCHA in June 2022 and updated in October 2022.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix presents the outcomes of the technical review and was\ncompleted by Mohammad Shamsudduha, Associate Professor in Humanitarian Science\nat the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London, in December\n2022.\n● The Implementation Plan summarizes the concrete actions that the trigger mechanism\nwill inform and was developed by OCHA in October 2022.\n● The Ethical Matrix identies issues that may come up in the implementation of the\ntrigger mechanism and stakeholders that may be impacted by those issues. The Ethical\nMatrix was completed in January 2023 by Andrea Romaoli Garcia, ITU Topic Driver on\nOpen Code.\nThe sections below provide a summary of the main ndings and recommendations developed in\nthe review.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The intended use of the predictive model is appropriate.\n● The model may not detect localized rainfall shortages, which could lead to the model\nmissing a trigger where it should detect increased drought risk. In addition, crop failure\ndepends on a number of factors other than rainfall, including the use and availability of\ngroundwater for irrigation as well as changes in temperature. The fact that these\nadditional factors are not included in the model should be considered in the\ninterpretation of model outputs.\nModel Development and Documentation\n● The resolution of the spatial coverage of the predictive model is very high at 0.05\ndegrees. The predictive model produces outputs on a monthly basis. The geographic\nscope of the predictive model includes the entire country of Niger. These parameters are\nappropriate for a national-scale model.\n● The spatial resolution of the predictive model at 0.05 degrees is too high given that the\npredictive model is primarily dependent on precipitation variability. Correlation between\nforecasts and observational rainfall data produced by CHIRPS is weak in Maradi and\nNiamey regions, where the irrigation is the highest in the country.\nModel Evaluation\n● The predictive model is evaluated using accuracy, hit rate, miss rate, false positives and\nfalse negatives as parameters. These model evaluation criteria are appropriate for this\npredictive model.\n● A comparison between the predictive model outputs and NextGen forecasts was based\nonly on CHIRPS gridded rainfall data. No detailed information is provided on the\ndownscaling of the forecasts and evaluation of the downscaled technique.\nOperational Readiness\n● Activities and funding are provided on a “no-regrets” basis after a trigger activation.\nActivities and funding are purposefully selected to still be valuable in the absence of a\nshock. The addition of an observational trigger based on SPI is a strength of this\nanticipatory trigger mechanism.\n● The forecast accuracy could be improved if the predictive model is tailored to individual\nareas within Niger.\n● There is little mention of local/national capacity building or strengthening in the process.\n● The performance of the predictive model should be evaluated against the observational\nmodel outputs to better understand the weaknesses in the predictive model.\nStrengthening the predictive model outputs increases the potential impact of the trigger\nmechanism due to the increased lead time.\n● The low or even negative correlation between the predictive model outputs and CHIRPS\nprecipitation in the northern part of Niger should be examined to improve the\nperformance and validity of the predictive model.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nFalse negative activation (non-activation in the presence of a shock)\n● A false negative would deprive the community of timely aid.\n● Recommendation: The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously evaluated\nagainst the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS precipitation data to\nlower the likelihood of false negatives.\nFalse positive activation (activation in the absence of a shock)\n● A false positive would increase the risk of wasted nancial resources. Such error could\nundermine the condence of stakeholders and donors and could lead to discontinuation\nof the trigger mechanism. A false negative primarily impacts other stakeholders,\nincluding local NGOs, the model developers and UN entities, due to the misallocation of\nresources. It also undermines trust in the trigger mechanism.\n● Recommendation: A false positive is more tolerable compared to a false negative, as a\nfalse positive triggers activities and funding that benet the population even in the\nabsence of a shock. The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously\nevaluated against the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS\nprecipitation data to lower the likelihood of false positives.\nIdentity exposure (exposure of individual identities through potential use of additional data\nsources in implementation of the model)\n● Unauthorized access to any personal data used in future implementation of the trigger\nmechanism could cause harm and carries reputational risk.\n● Recommendation: Given that the trigger mechanism does not include the use of any\npersonal data there is little concern that a data breach could result in re-identication. If\nthe implementation of the trigger mechanism evolves over time to include additional\npersonal data, the tools and infrastructure used in implementation should be\nre-evaluated and adjusted as needed to mitigate the risk of identity exposure.\nBias in available data\n● Bias in data availability resulting from gaps in data for different regions in Niger could\naffect the allocation of funding and activities.\n● Recommendation: Determine whether there are gaps resulting in biases in climate data\navailability for Niger in order to prevent unfair allocation of funding and activities.\nFeedback\nThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic, research and\nprivate sector to engage with us on the peer review process. Please send feedback on the Peer Review\nFramework to centrehumdata@un.org."

Res. Lett., 36, L19803,\ndoi:10.1029/2009GL040248.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The production of tropospheric ozone (O3), a criteria\nair pollutant and potent greenhouse gas, is a complex\nfunction of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), volatile\norganic compounds (VOC), sunlight, and trace oxidants\nsuch as the hydroxyl radical (OH). O3 production is nonlinearly dependent on NOx abundance and thus accurate\ndescription of the processes that remove NOx radicals is\ncritical for predicting the down-wind influence of anthropogenic emissions on tropospheric O3. Global modeling\nstudies suggest that nocturnal processes involving the\nreactions of the nitrate radical (NO3) and N2O5 account\nfor 50% of the globally averaged annual net NOx removal\n[Dentener and Crutzen, 1993]. However, the impact of\nnocturnal NOx removal processes on the tropospheric O3\nbudget continues to be limited by uncertainty in the reaction\nrate of N2O5 with aerosol particles.\n[3] The influence of N2O5 on the removal of atmospheric\nNOx radicals is determined by the product of the probability\nthat N2O5 will react on a particle given a collision, g(N2O5),\nand the total gas-particle collision frequency primarily set\nby the available particle surface area concentration (Sa).\nUntil recently, direct measurements of g(N2O5) have been\nrestricted to the laboratory, where simplified model particle\ntypes are probed to ascertain functional dependences. These\nstudies have shown that N2O5 removal by particles and the\nresulting products are strongly dependent on: i) liquid water\ncontent (H2O(l)) [Thornton et al., 2003], ii) particle nitrate\n(NO3\n), which inhibits N2O5 hydrolysis [Wahner et al.,\n1998], iii) the presence of additional nucleophiles in water\nstressed particles [Behnke et al., 1997], iv) organic coatings\nthat have been theorized to either suppress N2O5 accommodation or decrease water availability at the surface\n[McNeill et al., 2006; Folkers et al., 2003], and v) particle\nacidity [Mozurkewich and Calvert, 1988]. These effects\nlead to measured g(N2O5) that span three orders of magnitude (1  104 < g < 0.1) depending on the chemical and\nphysical properties of the particles employed. Consistent\nwith this large potential variability, recent analyses of NO3\nand N2O5 field measurements have inferred that g(N2O5)\ncan range from 1  103 to 0.017 and is likely dependent\non particle chemical composition [Brown et al., 2006].\n[4] In the context of atmospheric particle composition,\nthe importance of the above dependences, either individually or as a whole, remains entirely unclear. Combining our\ndirect measurements of g(N2O5) on ambient particles with\nco-located observations of particle chemical composition\nand particle Sa, gas phase precursors, and meteorological\nparameters, allows such evaluations and the elucidation of\nfactors that most likely control g(N2O5) on ambient particles.\n2. Experimental Design\n[5] The pseudo-first order rate coefficient for N2O5 loss\nto aerosol particles (khet) was measured directly using an\nentrained aerosol flow reactor coupled to a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) [Kercher et al., 2009].\nThe experimental technique is described in detail elsewhere\n[Bertram et al., 2009]. Observations of g(N2O5) were made\nat two urban sampling locations during the summer of 2008.\nBetween July 3rd and 21st, observations were made from a\n10 m tower adjacent to the NOAA Earth System Research\nLaboratory in Boulder, CO. Particle size distributions (65 nm\nto 1 mm) were measured by an ultra-high sensitivity aerosol\nspectrometer and particle composition measured by an\nAerodyne compact time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer\n[DeCarlo et al., 2006; Drewnick et al., 2005]. Coincident\nmeasurements of gas-phase precursors (e.g., O3 and NO)\nand basic meteorological parameters were also made during\nthe sampling period. Between August 6th and 16th, observations were made from a 5 m sampling mast extending\nabove an instrument sea container located at the NOAA\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L19803, doi:10.1029/2009GL040248, 2009 Click\nHere for\nFull\nArticle\n1\nDepartment of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Washington,\nSeattle, Washington, USA. 2\nNow at Department of Chemistry, University of California, San Diego,\nLa Jolla, California, USA. 3\nDepartment of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle,\nWashington, USA. 4\nEarth System Research Laboratory, NOAA, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n5\nCIRES, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n6\nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, NOAA, Seattle, Washington,\nUSA.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276/09/2009GL040248$05.00\nL19803 1 of 5\nPacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, 10 km NE of\ndowntown Seattle, WA. Particle size distributions (10 nm to\n10 mm) were measured with two differential mobility\nparticle sizing instruments and aerodynamic particle sizer.\nSub-micron particle composition was measured by an\nAerodyne quadrupole aerosol mass spectrometer [Jayne et\nal., 2000].\n[6] We interpret these results using a newly developed\nparameterization of g(N2O5) [Bertram and Thornton, 2009]\nthat is driven by observations of particle composition and\nRH, and calculations of H2O(l) as determined by the aerosol\ninorganics model (AIM Model II) [Carslaw et al., 1995].\nThis approach permits us to directly assess the dependence\nof the observed g(N2O5) on the factors outlined in section 1.\n3. Observed Dependence of g(N2O5) on Particle\nChemical Composition\n[7] In Boulder, the ambient RH was low (30 ± 15%),\nparticle loadings were rather uniform (mean Sa = 108 ± 35,\ntotal mass = 5.3 ± 1.5 mg m3\n), and particles contained high\norganic mass fractions (mean organic/sulfate mass ratio =\n6.1 ± 3.9). The median g(N2O5) observed in Boulder was\n0.003 (interquartile range of 0.9– 1.2  103\n). In contrast,\nin Seattle, the ambient RH was higher (74 ± 13%), particle\nloadings were enhanced and more variable (mean Sa = 190 ±\n115, total mass = 7.2 ± 4.1 mg m3\n), but particles had similar\nbulk particle chemical composition as in Boulder (mean\norganic/sulfate = 7.1 ± 4.8). The median g(N2O5) observed\nin Seattle was 0.009 (interquartile range of 0.26 – 2.9\n102\n), a factor of three larger than measured in Boulder.\n[8] These differences in the median g(N2O5) are grossly\nconsistent with the difference in RH between the two\nlocations leading to lower H2O(l) in Boulder relative to\nSeattle. But, RH alone is not sufficient for describing either\nthe observed variability in, or the level of suppression of\ng(N2O5) relative to that expected on aqueous solution\nparticles. For example, the strongly decreasing trend of\ng(N2O5) with the increasing mass ratio of particulate\norganic matter (POM) to sulfate (SO4\n2) observed in the\nSeattle data, and the lack of such a correlation in the\nBoulder data (Figure 1a), provide insights into the particle\ncharacteristics that exert control over g(N2O5). In what\nfollows, we investigate the dependence of g(N2O5) on\nPOM, making the reasonable assumption that the aerosol\nparticles are largely internal mixtures [Murphy et al., 2006]\n(see auxiliary material).1\n[9] In the absence of POM, g(N2O5) should be controlled\nby the RH-dependent liquid water content and the molarity\nof nucleophiles such as NO3\n and chloride (Cl) [Bertram\nand Thornton, 2009; Griffiths et al., 2009; Wahner et al.,\n1998; Behnke et al., 1997]. In both locations studied, when\nPOM/SO4\n2 was lowest, the non-refractory particle composition was mainly ammonium sulfate (AS) with trace NO3\n\nand Cl (Figure S1), and our observations of g(N2O5) are in\ngood agreement with both laboratory measurements and the\nparameterization of Bertram and Thornton [2009]. Probing\nthe response of g(N2O5) to an increasing mass fraction of\nPOM, in both Boulder and Seattle, permits us to assess the\npotential affects of POM on g(N2O5). POM has been\nsuggested to influence g(N2O5) via: i) altering H2O(l),\nwhich has been shown to influence g(N2O5) either through\na direct H2O(l) limitation [Thornton et al., 2003] or by\nchanging particle [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] [Mentel et al., 1999], and/\nor ii) the formation of organic coatings on aqueous cores\nthat inhibit the accommodation or reaction of N2O5 [Badger\net al., 2006; McNeill et al., 2006; Folkers et al., 2003].\n[10] The small g(N2O5) values and lack of correlation\nwith POM observed in Boulder indicates that the particles\nsampled were either solid (independent of POM mass\nfraction) or that increases in POM did not lead to the\nassociated increase in H2O(l) required to enhance g(N2O5).\nInterestingly, our observed g(N2O5) values are consistent\nwith that predicted by the Bertram and Thornton [2009]\nparameterization regardless of the AS phase state. Laboratory measurements of g(N2O5) are <0.005 on crystalline AS\n[Mozurkewich and Calvert, 1988], similar to the median of\n0.003 observed in Boulder. If AS crystallization was\ninhibited by the available POM [Parsons et al., 2004] and\nwe treat POM as hygroscopic (i.e. malonic acid like),\nFigure 1. (a) Observed dependence of g(N2O5) on the\nmass ratio of POM to SO4\n2 for measurements made in\nSeattle (black) and Boulder (gray). (b) Calculated dependence of the molar ratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n on the mass ratio\nof POM to SO4\n2 for measurements made in Seattle,\nassuming that POM does (circles) and does not (squares)\ncontribute to H2O(l) uptake. Data points are equal\npopulation binned medians, where the bar corresponds to\nthe interquartile range of the calculations. The shaded\nregion (in panel b) represents values of [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n]\nwhere laboratory measurements predict suppression in\ng(N2O5) due to the NO3\n effect.\n1\nAuxiliary materials are available in the HTML. doi:10.1029/\n2009GL040248.\nL19803 BERTRAM ET AL.: DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF N2O5 REACTIVITY L19803\n2 of 5\ncalculations made using the Bertram and Thornton [2009]\nparameterization show that at the low RH sampled,\n[H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] is low enough to significantly suppress\ng(N2O5) to <0.005 across the entire range of POM/SO4\n2\nobserved in Boulder. Co-located measurements of g(N2O5)\nand particle phase state [Martin et al., 2008] will clearly\nallow such distinctions to be made in the future.\n[11] The behavior of g(N2O5) observed in Seattle, at\nhigher RH, more clearly illustrates the importance of\nunderstanding POM in order to assess the factors controlling g(N2O5). The dependence of g(N2O5) on POM/SO4\n2\nwas observed during a stagnation episode in which most of\nthe POM mass growth was likely due to SOA formation as\nindicated by the fraction of POM that is measured to be\nhighly oxidized (see Figure S4). In light of the above\nexpectations, the decreasing g(N2O5) with increasing\nPOM/SO4\n2 can be hypothesized to be a result of: i) a\nrelative decrease in the particulate water mass fraction,\nfollowing increased partitioning of organics that are less\nhygroscopic than AS (i.e. DH2O(l)/DPOM \u0004 0), leading to\nboth an increased nitrate effect [Wahner et al., 1998] and a\npossible H2O(l) limitation [Thornton et al., 2003], and/or\nii) an increasing role of organic coatings that limit either\nN2O5 surface accommodation or N2O5 accessibility to\nH2O(l).\n[12] To examine these suppositions, we first calculate\n[H2O(l)] and [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] using AIM for the two\nextremes of POM hygroscopicity: i) POM does not contribute to H2O(l) uptake, and ii) POM is highly hygroscopic,\ncontributing significantly to H2O(l) (POM treated as\nmalonic acid) (Figure 1b). In both cases [H2O(l)] is sufficiently high (>20M), so as not to suppress g(N2O5) directly.\nThe molar ratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n remains nearly constant\nwhen POM is allowed to contribute to H2O(l), but decreases\nwith increasing POM/SO4\n2 when POM is prohibited from\ncontributing to H2O(l). To determine whether the calculated\nchanges in [H2O(l)]/[NO3\n] are sufficient for describing the\nobserved changes in g(N2O5), we use the parameterization\nfor g(N2O5) described by Bertram and Thornton [2009].\n[13] Figure 2 depicts the parameterization-observation\ncomparison for both cases as a function of the molar ratio\nof H2O(l) to NO3\n. The strong parameterization-observation\nagreement, shown in panel A, lends support to the conclusion that POM sampled in Seattle did not contribute\nsignificantly to H2O(l). Such a notion would be generally\nconsistent with the findings of Mochida et al. [2008] and\nQuinn et al. [2005], where ambient observations revealed\ndecreases in RH-dependent particle growth factors or scattering efficiency in the presence of large organic mass\nfractions. Based on our observations alone, we cannot rule\nout the possibility that organic coatings may act to offset the\neffects of hygroscopic organics (Figure 2b). Nonetheless, it\nis clear that the presence and chemical properties of POM\nplay a decisive role in setting g(N2O5) in the troposphere.\nFurther measurements of g(N2O5) downwind of source\nregions, where POM is likely more oxidized [Zhang et\nal., 2007], and more hygroscopic [Kondo et al., 2007], and/\nor alongside co-located observations of particle hygroscopic\ngrowth will be strong tests of this hypothesis and the\napplicability of these first results to regional and global\nmodels.\n4. Implications for NOx Processing Rates\n[14] Quantifying the absolute magnitude of g(N2O5) and\nultimately the loss rate of N2O5 to particles is necessary for\nreliable model representations of NOx, OH, O3, and particle\nabundances and the couplings between them. The sensitivity of the NOx budget to g(N2O5) is a strong function of the\nNO3 and N2O5 production rates, Sa, temperature, and NO3\nreactivity. To assess the importance of g(N2O5) we examine\nthe fraction of NOx present at sunset, [NOx]sunset, that is lost\nat night as a function of g(N2O5).\nFlost ¼ ½ \u0005 NOx Sunset  ½ \u0005 NOx Sunrise\n½ \u0005 NOx Sunset\nE1\nFigure 2. Comparison of parameterized [Bertram and Thornton, 2009] and observed g(N2O5) as a function of the molar\nratio of H2O(l) to NO3\n assuming (a) that POM does not contribute to H2O(l) uptake and (b) that POM contributes to H2O(l)\nuptake. Data points are separated into equal population bins, where the bar and whiskers correspond to the median to mean\nrange and the interquartile range of the observations, respectively. The parameterized g(N2O5), derived from the observed\nparticle chemical composition and RH, is shown with black solid lines and the shaded region represents the propagated\nuncertainty in its determination. The dashed black line depicts g(N2O5) as parameterized for regions where direct\nmeasurements of g(N2O5) were not available.\nL19803 BERTRAM ET AL.: DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF N2O5 REACTIVITY L19803\n3 of 5\nThe dependence of Flost on g(N2O5) and NO3 reactivity, as\ncalculated using a time-dependent chemical box model (see\nSI) for characteristic summer and winter conditions, is\nshown in Figure 3. We chose conditions (e.g., temperature\nand NO3 reactivity) in order to bracket the range of possible\nsensitivities to g(N2O5). In our summer calculations, Flost is\nprimarily limited by the NO3 production rate and nearly\nindependent of g(N2O5) due to assuming high loadings of\nbiogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), which\nincrease NO3 reactivity, and warmer temperatures, which\nshift the N2O5-NO3 equilibrium in favor of NO3. The result\nis that at high NO3 reactivity the nocturnal loss of NOx is\nindependent of g(N2O5). During winter, BVOC emissions\nare significantly smaller, and lower temperatures shift the\nN2O5-NO3 equilibrium in favor of N2O5. As a result, Flost is\nfar more sensitive to g(N2O5) during winter than in summer.\nThese calculations illustrate the acute sensitivity of the NOx\nbudget to changes in g(N2O5) between 1  104 and 0.1\nand imply that the NOx lifetime is strongly dependent on\nNO3 reactivity at low g(N2O5).\n[15] In addition to accurate predictions of the total\nnocturnal NOx loss, models must also correctly attribute\nthat loss between the N2O5 and NO3 channels to achieve a\nrealistic sensitivity of the NOx budget to changes in VOC,\ntemperature, and particle loadings. Our modeling shows this\nbranching is sensitive to g(N2O5) for the majority of likely\nconditions. The reaction products for the two channels have\ndifferent effects on oxidant concentrations and particle mass\nloadings: the products of NO3 homogeneous reactions can\nlead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol [Ng et\nal., 2008] and the heterogeneous reaction of N2O5 can lead\nto halogen activation [Finlayson-Pitts et al., 1989] or\nincreased particulate nitrate mass [Riemer et al., 2003].\n[16] When compared to predictions of g(N2O5) made\nusing two currently implemented large-scale model parameterizations [Davis et al., 2008; Evans and Jacob, 2005],\nour directly observed reactivity values are both more\nvariable and as much as a factor of ten lower, consistent\nwith reactivity values inferred from aircraft observations of\nNO3 and N2O5 [Brown et al., 2009]. If our observations\ndescribed herein are representative of other urban/suburban\nlocations, then incorporating the observed g(N2O5) into\ncurrent models would likely lead to increases in predicted\nO3 and OH, and an increased sensitivity of NOx loss to both\nNO3 reactivity and particle loadings.\n5. Conclusions\n[17] We present an analysis of the first direct measurements of g(N2O5) on ambient aerosol particles. At the limit\nof low POM, our observations confirm RH as a primary\ncontrol and particulate nitrate as a secondary control in\nregulating g(N2O5). Observations at high RH illustrate a\nstrong dependence of g(N2O5) on particle POM/SO4\n2. Our\nrecent parameterization [Bertram and Thornton, 2009] can\nadequately capture the trend and variability in the observed\ng(N2O5) if we make the assumption that the increasing\nPOM mass fractions do not contribute significantly to\nadditional particulate water uptake at the same RH. In such\na case, the nitrate effect is sufficient to explain our results. If\nPOM does contribute to H2O(l) uptake, then our results\nsuggest an additional means of suppressing g(N2O5) that is\ncorrelated with oxidized POM such as organic coatings.\nRegardless, these results clearly indicate that regional and\nglobal modeling efforts need to consider the effects of\nparticulate organic loadings and hygroscopicity in parameterizing the rate of nocturnal NOx loss via N2O5 reactions\non particles.\n[18] Acknowledgments.

Background\nThis document summarizes the documentation and ndings developed in the peer review of the\nAnticipatory Action Trigger for Drought in Niger. The trigger mechanism was designed for an\nanticipatory action framework coordinated by OCHA. The goal of the trigger mechanism is to\ndetect increased drought risk in Niger and trigger the release of funds from the Central\nEmergency Response Fund in anticipation of drought-related humanitarian needs. The release\nof funds can be triggered from six months ahead of the rainy season (which runs from July\nthrough September) until one month into the season. The trigger mechanism includes a\npredictive model that uses seasonal precipitation forecasts and an observational model that\nuses the Standardized Precipitation Index.\nThe review was conducted between May 2022 and January 2023.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nThe documentation describing the model and its application, as well as the outcomes of the\nreview process, are available through the following links:\n● The Model Card describes version 1 of the trigger mechanism. It was completed by\nOCHA in June 2022 and updated in October 2022.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix presents the outcomes of the technical review and was\ncompleted by Mohammad Shamsudduha, Associate Professor in Humanitarian Science\nat the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London, in December\n2022.\n● The Implementation Plan summarizes the concrete actions that the trigger mechanism\nwill inform and was developed by OCHA in October 2022.\n● The Ethical Matrix identies issues that may come up in the implementation of the\ntrigger mechanism and stakeholders that may be impacted by those issues. The Ethical\nMatrix was completed in January 2023 by Andrea Romaoli Garcia, ITU Topic Driver on\nOpen Code.\nThe sections below provide a summary of the main ndings and recommendations developed in\nthe review.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\n● The intended use of the predictive model is appropriate.\n● The model may not detect localized rainfall shortages, which could lead to the model\nmissing a trigger where it should detect increased drought risk. In addition, crop failure\ndepends on a number of factors other than rainfall, including the use and availability of\ngroundwater for irrigation as well as changes in temperature. The fact that these\nadditional factors are not included in the model should be considered in the\ninterpretation of model outputs.\nModel Development and Documentation\n● The resolution of the spatial coverage of the predictive model is very high at 0.05\ndegrees. The predictive model produces outputs on a monthly basis. The geographic\nscope of the predictive model includes the entire country of Niger. These parameters are\nappropriate for a national-scale model.\n● The spatial resolution of the predictive model at 0.05 degrees is too high given that the\npredictive model is primarily dependent on precipitation variability. Correlation between\nforecasts and observational rainfall data produced by CHIRPS is weak in Maradi and\nNiamey regions, where the irrigation is the highest in the country.\nModel Evaluation\n● The predictive model is evaluated using accuracy, hit rate, miss rate, false positives and\nfalse negatives as parameters. These model evaluation criteria are appropriate for this\npredictive model.\n● A comparison between the predictive model outputs and NextGen forecasts was based\nonly on CHIRPS gridded rainfall data. No detailed information is provided on the\ndownscaling of the forecasts and evaluation of the downscaled technique.\nOperational Readiness\n● Activities and funding are provided on a “no-regrets” basis after a trigger activation.\nActivities and funding are purposefully selected to still be valuable in the absence of a\nshock. The addition of an observational trigger based on SPI is a strength of this\nanticipatory trigger mechanism.\n● The forecast accuracy could be improved if the predictive model is tailored to individual\nareas within Niger.\n● There is little mention of local/national capacity building or strengthening in the process.\n● The performance of the predictive model should be evaluated against the observational\nmodel outputs to better understand the weaknesses in the predictive model.\nStrengthening the predictive model outputs increases the potential impact of the trigger\nmechanism due to the increased lead time.\n● The low or even negative correlation between the predictive model outputs and CHIRPS\nprecipitation in the northern part of Niger should be examined to improve the\nperformance and validity of the predictive model.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nFalse negative activation (non-activation in the presence of a shock)\n● A false negative would deprive the community of timely aid.\n● Recommendation: The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously evaluated\nagainst the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS precipitation data to\nlower the likelihood of false negatives.\nFalse positive activation (activation in the absence of a shock)\n● A false positive would increase the risk of wasted nancial resources. Such error could\nundermine the condence of stakeholders and donors and could lead to discontinuation\nof the trigger mechanism. A false negative primarily impacts other stakeholders,\nincluding local NGOs, the model developers and UN entities, due to the misallocation of\nresources. It also undermines trust in the trigger mechanism.\n● Recommendation: A false positive is more tolerable compared to a false negative, as a\nfalse positive triggers activities and funding that benet the population even in the\nabsence of a shock. The outputs of the predictive model should be continuously\nevaluated against the outputs of the observational model and against CHIRPS\nprecipitation data to lower the likelihood of false positives.\nIdentity exposure (exposure of individual identities through potential use of additional data\nsources in implementation of the model)\n● Unauthorized access to any personal data used in future implementation of the trigger\nmechanism could cause harm and carries reputational risk.\n● Recommendation: Given that the trigger mechanism does not include the use of any\npersonal data there is little concern that a data breach could result in re-identication. If\nthe implementation of the trigger mechanism evolves over time to include additional\npersonal data, the tools and infrastructure used in implementation should be\nre-evaluated and adjusted as needed to mitigate the risk of identity exposure.\nBias in available data\n● Bias in data availability resulting from gaps in data for different regions in Niger could\naffect the allocation of funding and activities.\n● Recommendation: Determine whether there are gaps resulting in biases in climate data\navailability for Niger in order to prevent unfair allocation of funding and activities.\nFeedback\nThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic, research and\nprivate sector to engage with us on the peer review process.

In future framework versions a clear strategy\nfor the involvement of affected populations and an approach to accountability to affected\npopulations should be identied.\nLack of Transparency\nLack of transparency refers to the algorithms not being made available or not being transparent.\nThe anticipatory action framework should reect clearer strategies to engage with local leaders\nto better understand what is happening on the ground and obtain early buy-in. Mitigation\nstrategy for a potential lack of transparency should be expanded in the model card and/or the\nanticipatory action framework.\nInaction\nInaction refers to the situation in which drought impact is predicted but no action is taken.\nInaction in case of trigger activation is unlikely, given the pre-allocated nancing attached to it\nand the UN-validated anticipatory action framework. Inaction might nevertheless be a\npossibility, if government or local authorities block the roll-out of interventions on the ground or\nin case of conict upsurge. The team could consider adding a consensus-based\ndecision-making option around activation or non-activation in the event of specic events or\nsituational context not considered in the model design (e.g., higher levels of vulnerability or\nincrease in armed conict, etc.)\nFeedback\nThe Centre invites individuals and organizations working in the humanitarian, academic,\nresearch and private sector to engage with us on the peer review process. Please send feedback\non the Framework to centrehumdata@un.org."

            "value": "CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 1\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 2\nAbout this series: The climate crisis is intensifying humanitarian emergencies around the world and\nhumanitarians are increasingly having to incorporate climate data and forecasts into their analysis\nand planning. This guidance series has been developed to help humanitarians to access, analyze and\ninterpret common types of climate and weather data, and to provide a common language for working\nwith meteorological and hydrological services.\n• Observational rainfall data such as CHIRPS or ARC2 captures how much rain has fallen over a\ndefined period of time.\n• The rainfall is measured at weather stations or estimated through satellite or radar imagery.\n• The data can be presented as the total amount of rainfall observed over the period of time,\nor as below, at or above normal conditions.\n• Datasets that combine station data and satellite or radar imagery are the recommended\nsource of data for humanitarian purposes.\n• Observational rainfall data can be analyzed to answer a range of questions, such as:\n• What areas are currently affected by drought, and how severely?\n• What was the duration of the longest dry spell during the past rainy season?\n• How many days of heavy rainfall were there in the week leading up to the floods?\n• Which area received the most rain last month?\n• How often does an area experience dry spells?\n• How does this year’s rainfall compare to previous years?\nKey takeaways\nWhat is observational rainfall data?\nObservational rainfall data captures how much rain fell over a defined period of time,\nranging from an hour to a day. This data can then be used to calculate the total rainfall for\ndifferent time periods, such as 5 days (pentad), 10 days (dekad), a week, a month or a season.\nObservational rainfall datasets can go back decades and have broad geographic coverage,\nenabling historical trend analysis and comparisons.\nObservational rainfall data is produced by measuring the amount of rainfall at precise\nlocations, which are called measuring stations or gauges (e.g., the stars in Figure 1 below).\nStation data is typically obtained from national or regional meteorological services and should\nonly be used in accordance with their guidance. Some of the advantages of station data are\nthat it is accurate at the specific locations, it is collected frequently and it has been collected\nover the long-term, allowing for trend analysis. On the other hand, station data is only\navailable for specific locations and is subject to bias due to wind, evaporation, and changes in\nmeasurement devices. Contact the local or regional meteorological services to learn whether\nstation data is available, where the stations are located, how often the data is updated, and\nwhether historical records are available.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 3\nRainfall can also be estimated using satellite or radar images that cover areas several square\nkilometers wide (e.g., the squares in Figure 1 below). Satellite imagery is typically obtained\nby global providers and academic or research centers (e.g., the Climate Hazards Center) who\nshare their derived estimates publicly. Satellite or radar images are useful for understanding\npatterns over larger geographic areas. Some of the advantages of satellite data are that it has\nextensive geographic coverage, including in remote and inaccessible areas, and that it is shared\nin a continuous and consistent way. On the other hand, satellite measurements are subject to\nerrors due to cloud contamination, and the data has a shorter historical record.\nFigure 1. Weather Stations in Zambia (red stars). The grid superimposed onto the map consists of individual\nboxes, each of which corresponds to a particular location where satellite weather measurements are\nconducted by certain providers. In this case, the grid is the one used by the ARC2 dataset (see below). The\nsize of each box is 0.1 degree (about 11 km at the equator).\nIn order to help correct for the inaccuracies and errors that are present in the two types of data\nand take advantage of their individual strengths, research institutions have produced rainfall\ndatasets that combine station and satellite/radar observations. Datasets that combine these\nobservations are the recommended source of data for humanitarian purposes.\nObservational precipitation data can be presented in various formats, each providing unique\ninsights into precipitation patterns. The most common representation is through absolute\nvalues, which reflect the actual amount of precipitation observed at a specific location and time,\ntypically measured in millimeters. Precipitation averages, which are calculated from historical\nrecords over a period of typically at least 10 years, can be produced for a specific location,\nseason, or year. A precipitation anomaly represents the deviation from the expected or average\nprecipitation over a particular period, which can be expressed as a difference in millimeters\nor as a percentage. The purpose of the analysis determines the most useful representation.\nAbsolute values provide insight into the total precipitation received at a location, while\nanomalies and averages help to understand long-term trends, including dry or wet periods,\nwhich is valuable for assessing drought or excessive rainfall conditions severity.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 4\n1 https://data.humdata.org/organization/wfp?q=chirps\n2 The dataset spans the latitude range 50°S-50°N, and all longitudes.\n3 CHIRPS produces a preliminary version of their estimates with a latency of two days. The final version is published in the third week of the\n following month.\nCommon sources of observational rainfall data\nAmong the many sources of data available, we introduce here two common sources of\nobservational rainfall data, both of which combine station and satellite data: CHIRPS and ARC2.\nCHIRPS refers to the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data and is\nproduced by scientists from the US Geological Survey and the Climate Hazards Center at the\nUniversity of Santa Barbara. ARC2 refers to Africa Rainfall Climatology Version 2 and it is\nproduced by The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center\nfor the Famine Early Warning System. You can access the data directly from these providers, or\nuse the tabular CHIRPS datasets that provides pre-computed rainfall metrics at admin2 and is\navailable on HDX.1\nCOMPARISON OF CHIRPS AND ARC2 OBSERVATIONAL RAINFALL DATA\nSource CHIRPS ARC2\nFormat Raster Raster\nGeographical coverage Global (quasi2) Africa\nSpatial granularity\n(also referred to as spatial\nresolution)\n0.05 degree (5.5 km at the equator) 0.1 degree (11 km at the equator)\nTemporal granularity\n(aso referred to as temporal\nresolution)\nDaily rainfall3 Daily rainfall\nHistorical coverage 1981 - today 1983 - today\nPublication Every month, around the third week of\nthe following month\nEvery day, with a 2-day lag\nMost common uses • Monthly, seasonal, or yearly rainfall\nmonitoring\n• Included in other tools including\nthose used for drought monitoring and\nFEWS NET assessments\n• Trend analysis across years\n• Near real-time monitoring in Africa\n• Year-to-year comparisons in Africa\nQuestions to answer with observational rainfall data\nObservational rainfall data can be used to answer a number of questions and inform decision\nmaking in humanitarian operations. Examples include:\n• How much rain fell in the past x days/weeks/months? Observational rainfall datasets\nprovide data on the total amount of rainfall for an area over a discrete period of time, which\ncan be aggregated and used to calculate rainfall over different time intervals. \nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 5\n• Was the rainfall last month above or below normal? And by how much? Observational\nrainfall data goes back decades and can therefore be used to determine whether rainfall for\na month or a season is above, at or below the historical average.\n• Were there more rainy days this month than last month? Observational rainfall data is\navailable for each day and can be used to determine if it rained or not on a given day and to\ncount the number of dry or wet days during a specific period of time.\n• How many dry spells were there during the past rainy season? How long was the\nlongest dry spell and the heaviest rain streak this past rainy season? Observational\nrainfall data can be used to detect the occurrence, location and duration of dry spells and\nprolonged periods of heavy rain.\n• How often in the past decade were more than x millimeters of rainfall measured?\nObservational rainfall data provides daily rainfall totals in millimeters and can be used to\nassess how often an area received rain above or below a given threshold.\n• Which region received the most rain last month? Observational rainfall data can be\naggregated to provide rainfall totals for larger geographic areas and then used to compare\nrain for that area.\nObservational rainfall data cannot answer the following questions:\n• How much will it rain during a period of time in the future? Observational rainfall data is\nreferred to as observational because it describes what happened in the past. It does not tell\nyou anything about future rainfall.\n• Is a severe flooding event about to occur? Are we going through a severe drought?\nObservational rainfall data does not provide sufficient information to inform you about the\nrisk of flooding in the near future or how severe a drought is likely to be. This is because\nfloods and droughts are complex phenomena caused by several interacting factors and they\ncannot be explained exclusively by the amount of precipitation.\n• How much rainfall from a given period of time in the past was due to specific tropical\nstorm or typhoon? It is hard to differentiate between the amount of rain caused by\naverage atmospheric conditions and the amount of rain induced by a specific atmospheric\nphenomenon. As a result, using observational rainfall data alone, it is not possible to say how\nmuch rainfall is due strictly to a tropical storm or typhoon. More data is needed to infer the\norigin of a heavy rainfall event.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 6\n4 Learn more: https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps\n5 Learn more here: https://wiki.chc.ucsb.edu/CHIRPS_FAQ#What_is_the_spatial_density_of_station_data_used_in_CHIRPS.3F\nCommon limitations with observations rainfall data\nOnce you have identified how you want to use the data, it is important to bear in mind some\ncommon limitations when conducting your analysis.\n1. Low-amount or short-duration rainfall may be underreported in certain geographical\nterrains or during extreme precipitation events.4 Gauges are constantly being improved\nto reduce error and datasets that combine station and satellite/radar data are best at\ncorrecting for these limitations. However, it is still important to keep these limitations in\nmind, especially when doing analysis that is looking at meteorological events that involve\nlow-amount or short-duration rainfall, such as dry spells.\n2. There are fewer gauge stations in rural areas and certain developing countries, which\nmeans that observational rainfall data is often less accurate in these locations. Fewer gauge\nstations means that there are fewer measurements for that geographic area, resulting in\na less complete picture of what is happening on the ground. Differences in the amount of\nrainfall received in two locations might be missed if there are not stations to capture rainfall\nin both locations.5\n3. Observational rainfall data is usually provided as a raster dataset, where the geographic\narea is represented by a contiguous grid of cells, or pixels. Each cell represents a discrete\narea of land, and has a value associated with it but the cells do not neatly fit within\nadministrative boundaries. Calculating rainfall for an administrative area requires an\naggregation. The choice of the aggregation method (average, maximum, total etc.) as well\nas the choice of which cells to include within a given administrative division (all cells fully\nincluded, or all cells touched etc.) will impact the results. This is especially true for lower\nadministrative divisions. As a result, adding together the total rainfall for all the districts in a\nregion may not equal the total rainfall calculated for the region.\n4. If using station data, it is important to bear in mind that stations are easily subject to\ndeterioration and require frequent maintenance, which may affect their accuracy. For\nthis reason, calculating temporal averages, anomalies or trends over long periods of time\nshould be performed with care. When possible, verify with the provider the adequacy of\nthe measurements over long periods of time. This limitation does not apply to CHIRPS and\nARC2 datasets, which have been calibrated and combined with satellite observations by\nclimate institutions.\n5. For station data, differences exist between measuring instruments and quality of their\nmeasurements. This may heavily affect comparisons between different locations. Therefore,\nwhen performing geographical averages, it is preferable to use radar data, satellite data or\nobservational datasets already calibrated by institutions or universities such as CHIRPS or\nARC2.\nCENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DATA 7\nResources\n• Learn more about the CHIRPS6 and ARC27 observational datasets and/or download data\ndirectly from the providers.\n• CHIRPS on HDX8: Download pre-computed tabular data (CSV format) on precipitation totals,\naverages, anomalies per administrative region.\n• ARC29: Download 1-month or 10-day cumulative precipitation totals (raster, tabular, image\ndata).\n• OCHA AnticiPy10: Download raster (NetCDF) data directly from CHIRPS and ARC2 using a\nPython library.\n6 https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps\n7 https://www.icpac.net/data-center/arc2/\n8 https://data.humdata.org/dataset?q=CHIRPS\n9 https://gmes.icpac.net/data-center/arc2-rfe\n10 https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/ocha-anticipy\n11 https://centre.humdata.org/\n12 https://www.climate.columbia.edu/\n13 https://iri.columbia.edu/\n14 https://www.knmi.nl/over-het-knmi/about\nThis guidance was developed by the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data11 with input from\nColumbia University Climate School12 International Research Institute for Climate and Society13,\nthe Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute14, and the Earth Observation Unit of the Research,\nAssessment and Monitoring division of the World Food Programme."

Somalia Flood Exposure Methodology Note\nAnalysis for 2024 HNRP\nThis technical note summarises the methodology used to calculate the number of people\npotentially exposed to ooding in Somalia in the 2024 Somalia Humanitarian Needs and\nResponse Plan (HNRP). The UN OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data worked with a wide range\nof technical partners to develop a methodology that was then endorsed by the Somalia ICCG\nand HCT.\nDaily FloodScan (1998-2022) & WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) raster data was analysed to gain\nunderstanding of ood conditions across Somalia for both March-April-May (MAM) and\nOctober-November-December (OND) seasons. FloodScan daily ood fraction Standard Flood\nExposure Depiction (SFED) was aggregated to yearly seasonal maximum fraction composites\nfor both the MAM and OND seasons for all years of historical FloodScan data (1998-2022).\nThe yearly seasonal SFED composites were then processed/reclassied in two distinct ways:\n1. Composites reclassied to binary using a 20 percent ood fraction threshold.\n2. Composites masked to just remove any ood fraction values < 0.05 percent and the\nood fraction (0-100 percent) retained.\nAll composites in both sets of processed yearly-seasonal ood fraction rasters were then\nmultiplied by the WorldPop (2020 UN Adjusted) population estimate raster to create two sets of\nyearly seasonal ood exposure rasters. These were then aggregated at the second\nadministrative level via zonal statistics (sum) to obtain the estimated population exposure per\ndistrict for each season across all years for each set. These estimates were converted to the\npercent of population exposed by dividing the estimates by the total population per district\n(from World Pop raster). The percent exposure gure was then applied to the updated 2024\npopulation data set (UN OCHA, UNFPA Methodology) to obtain updated population exposure\nestimates. These data were further aggregated to administrative level 1.\nRanges for exposure were estimated using percentiles for both the MAM and OND seasons per\nadministrative level. As ECMWF seasonal forecast predicts an above average precipitation\nseason for MAM 2024, the range of population exposed was based on the 50th-95th percentile\nlevels. Since there was no available data to inform predictions for OND 2024, the 25-75th\npercentile values were used to bound the range. The lower and upper limits of the ranges were\nPage 1 of 2\ncalculated at the administrative level using all of the historical yearly seasonal ood exposure\nestimates. The two sets of range estimates were combined conservatively by taking the\nmaximum value for both the upper and lower bounds for each season.\nContact the OCHA Centre for Humanitarian Data via Leonardo Milano, Team Lead for Data\nScience at leonardo.milano@un.org with any questions or feedback.\nPage 2 of 2"

Background\nThis document summarizes the documentation and ndings of the peer review of the model\nused by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund to trigger the drought anticipatory action\nframework in Chad. The model is a go-no-go trigger mechanism designed to anticipate\nhumanitarian impacts of seasonal drought in a sub-region of Chad.\nThe review has been conducted between January and May 2023.\n2. Main Findings and Recommendations\nYou can nd all the documentation regarding the model, its application and the review process\nat the following links:\n● The Model Card describes the version of the model that was endorsed by humanitarian\naction in November 2022 and was completed in January 2023.\n● The Model Evaluation Matrix was completed in February 2023 by Carlos Osorio-Ramírez,\nAssociate Professor at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.\n● The Implementation Plan was completed in February 2023. It summarizes how the\ntrigger model is used to trigger anticipatory action and the agreed activation protocol.\n● The Ethical Matrix aims to identify all stakeholders and potential issues regarding the\nintended use of the model. The Ethical Matrix was completed in May 2023 by Anna Lena\nHuhn, Southern Africa Regional Anticipatory Action Advisor at the United Nations World\nFood Programme.\nA summary of the main ndings and recommendations is provided below.\n2.1 Technical Review\nIntended Use\nOverall, the use cases are well-described and adequately explained. The documentation of the\nlimitations of the model could be extended in its description, as is the case of the biomass\nanomaly and its connection with scenarios like extreme dryness or late onset.\nModel Development and Documentation\nIt is advisable to provide further documentation on the different data sources used by the team\nto validate the selection of indicators and estimate the performance of the model. Also, some\ndata is not available in a machine readable format and it would be good to explain how the team\ndealt with this issue.\nModel Evaluation\nIt is unclear what is an acceptable level of accuracy for the model. The team should better\narticulate how the performance benchmark was established and how the performance metrics\nwere evaluated and presented to the nal stakeholders.\nOperational Readiness\nIt would be good to expand the analysis of the missed activations of the models and the\npotential false alarms that the model could be providing.\n2.2 Ethical Review\nFalse Negatives\nA false negative occurs when no drought impact is predicted but drought conditions occur.\nThe team could consider additional mitigation strategies such as the use of citizen science or\nground observations to complement the forecast-based trigger.\nInsucient Data\nInsucient data refers to the gaps in impact data used to verify the forecast predictions.\nInsucient data might limit the precise prediction of forecasted humanitarian impact and\nexpose local populations to adverse humanitarian impact induced by a drought event, requiring\na large-scale humanitarian response ex-post. The team should consider the feasibility of adding\nfurther vulnerability layers in future iterations of the model.\nFalse Positives\nA false positive happens when drought impact is predicted but no drought conditions occur.\nAnticipatory action follows the ‘no regret’ principle, but a false alarm can still lead to inadequate\nresource allocation with a high potential impact on affected communities. The anticipatory\naction framework could indicate a precise mitigation strategy in a clearer manner.\nLack of Trust and Ownership\nLack of trust and ownership refers to the limited involvement of local and regional authorities in\nthe model design and validation. This may lead to little ownership and trust put into the model\nand eventually to political blockages in activations. In future framework versions a clear strategy\nfor the involvement of affected populations and an approach to accountability to affected\npopulations should be identied.\nLack of Transparency\nLack of transparency refers to the algorithms not being made available or not being transparent.\nThe anticipatory action framework should reect clearer strategies to engage with local leaders\nto better understand what is happening on the ground and obtain early buy-in.

Epidemiological Update\nGlobal reported COVID-19 cases in the Second Quarter 2022 (Q2 2022) declined by 71 percent, falling from 196 million\nto 57 million. This decline, however, likely reflects reduced testing and monitoring meaning fewer cases are detected.\nEven with testing scaled back, and despite the overall drop during Q2, reported COVID-19 cases rose in June globally for three\nconsecutive weeks. Regional increases in the Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and the Americas drove this\nincrease. This spike in reported COVID-19 may signal a larger increase in COVID-19 transmission cases beyond that reflected 2\nin reported figures, given lower rates of testing. The weekly rate of deaths remained stable globally, although increases in\ndeaths typically lag cases and thus could rise in coming weeks.\nThe Omicron variant comprises most COVID-19 cases (94 percent), with Omicron sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5\nincreasingly represented within sequenced samples. These two sub-variants appear more capable of evading immunity\nfrom vaccination or past infection. BA.4 and BA.5 were classified as Variants of Concern by the European Centre for Disease\nProtection in May 2022, and they are currently driving surges in COVID-19 cases in countries like the USA. 3\nCountries in the Global Humanitarian Overview (GHO) comprised 8 percent and 14 percent of global cases and deaths\nrespectively in Q2 2022, reporting 4.6 million deaths and 23,000 deaths. Of these 282,000 cases and 2,670 deaths\noccurred in countries with Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs). Across HRPs, Burundi (11 percent) and Guatemala (9\npercent) reported the largest increases in cases this quarter, while Guatemala (7 percent) and DRC (3 percent) reported the\nlargest increase in deaths. Humanitarian settings continue to face significant barriers to testing and surveillance, meaning\nmany COVID-19 cases and deaths may go unreported.\nFigure 1 & 2.

This is significantly more\nthan reported in official figures. Low rates of testing and surveillance masked initial reporting, but new data from WHO and\nother sources identify additional excess deaths likely attributable to COVID-19 occurring between 1 January 2020 and 31\nDecember 2021.4\nFurthermore, newly released data collected across 25 low- and middle-income countries finds that the risk of dying from\nCOVID-19 was twice as high in lower-income countries compared to high-income ones. This is likely due to low-income 5\ncountries having less access to vaccinations, weaker health care systems, more multigenerational households, and less ability\nto work from home. HRP countries included in this study are Colombia, Ethiopia, and Mozambique.\nFigure 5.

Low vaccination leaves humanitarian settings vulnerable to\nfuture surges and new variants. Even in settings where doses have been delivered, there remain barriers to administration\nincluding weak healthcare systems, vaccine hesitancy, compounding crises, and transport issues. Yemen, Somalia, Syria,\nChad, South Sudan, DRC, and Burundi are yet to administer more than one-third of delivered doses.\nSince the end of Q1, the overall vaccination rate across the AMC92 – the 92 lower-income countries eligible for\nfinancing support through COVAX to access vaccines – has increased from 40 percent to 47 percent, whereas the\naverage vaccination rate in the 34 countries for concerted support has increased from 7 to 10 percent. The COVID-19\nVaccine Delivery Partnership has been supporting the AMC92 countries since January 2022 in accelerating vaccine delivery\nwith a focus on the 34 countries at or below 10 percent vaccination coverage in January 2022. At the end of Q1, 19 countries\nwere at or below 10 percent coverage which has dropped slightly to 18 countries by the end of Q2. Of those 18 countries, 14\nface ongoing humanitarian emergencies, highlighting the challenges and complexities associated with vaccine delivery in a\ncontext of fragile health systems, competing health and humanitarian priorities, and significant logistical challenges. These\ncountries continue to exhibit low or flatlining vaccination rates, highlighting the need for more tailored approaches, including\ncloser engagement with humanitarian partners on the ground to support vaccine delivery.\nFigure 8. Population coverage by delivery and admin by HRP country\n(as of 30 June 2022)\nMore than 868 million in combined vaccine financing was approved by the World Bank (850 million) and GAVI’s Country\nDelivery Support (18.5 million) in Q2 2022, reaching eight GHO countries. This is a significant increase from total vaccine\nfinancing approved in Q1 2022, during which 257.8 million was approved for eight GHO countries.

Secondary Impacts\nEconomic Effects\nProjected economic growth declined further in 17 HRP countries from January to June 2022, with the compounding\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the secondary impacts of the war in Ukraine globally setting back GDP growth,\nrecovery of incomes to pre-pandemic levels, and poverty reduction. The pandemic lef the world more vulnerable to the 6\nsecondary economic shocks now stemming from the war in Ukraine, including rising food and fuel prices and inflation. As of\nJune 2022, global growth is expected to fall from 5.7 percent in 2021 to 2.9 percent in 2022, a growth rate 1.2 percent lower\nthan that predicted in January 2022. Global growth will likely be dampened through 2024 due to the lingering effects of the\npandemic and disruptions from the war. The World Bank predicts several years of above-average inflation and below-average\ngrowth. In 40 percent of developing economies, real income per capita will remain below pre-COVID-19 levels in 2023. Of the\n21 HRPs for which data is available, 17 face lower projected real GDP growth for 2022 and/or 2023 compared to growth\npredictions made in January 2022. Possible lockdowns, transport delays, or industry closures remain a downside risk to\nglobal economies.\n World Bank, ‘Global Economic Prospects,’ June 2022. 6\nSources: Epidemiological Update (World Health Organization, Our World in Data, Media sources); Vaccine update (Gavi, Our World in Data, UNICEF, WHO, World Bank, Media\nsources); Secondary Impacts (UNESCO, OCHA, IMF, World Bank, Media sources); Funding Update (OCHA) as of 1 July 2022.

Growth projections in June 2023 for HRPs, revised from January 2022\n(as of 30 June 2022)\nExpected GDP growth in 2023 has been reduced by a percentage point or more for 8 HRP countries, with Mozambique\n(-3.6), Sudan (-3), and Niger (-2.3) facing the steepest reductions in expected growth. Compounding crises – including\nclimate change, ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict and unrest, rising food and fuel prices, and food insecurity\nall contribute to lower economic growth in these settings. Future COVID-19 surges or new variants could further undermine\neconomic growth by increasing uncertainty and causing shipping delays. HRP countries are particularly vulnerable due to low\nrates of vaccination, limited access to therapeutics, and weakened healthcare systems. Projected 2022 GDP growth increased\nin six HRP countries, however, including Iraq and Nigeria, in part because they are oil exporting economies and thus benefit\nfrom rising commodity prices in recent months.\nHumanitarian settings also face significant debt risks, with four HRP countries – Chad, Mozambique, Somalia, and\nSudan – currently in debt distress. An additional seven are at high risk of debt distress. Debt servicing payments were\npaused during the COVID-19 pandemic, resuming in 2022 right as interest rates began to increase. This makes debt more\nexpensive and less sustainable for humanitarian settings. Wealthy countries pledged in 2021 to reallocate USD 100 billion in\nSpecial Drawing Rights to lower-income countries. At present, there are pledges to reallocate USD 60 billion. 7\nRoutine Immunization & Health\nFourteen immunization campaigns continue to be postponed due to COVID-19 in Q2 2022, impacting more than 52\nmillion people across 13 GHO countries. The postponement of these campaigns, targeting diseases like yellow fever,\nmeasles, cholera, and polio, increase the risk of secondary diseases spreading across humanitarian settings.\nMeasles cases, for instance, spiked by 79 percent in the first two months of 2022 compared to 2021. This is due to routine\nimmunization disruption caused by the pandemic.

Pakistan is currently experiencing a 9\nsurge in wild polio cases. Disruptions to routine immunization caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are another compounding 10\nfactor contributing to polio’s spread in Pakistan. In April 2020, more than 40 million children across Pakistan missed their\npolio vaccination afer the cancellation of an immunization campaign, with subsequent disruptions persisting throughout the\npandemic. National healthcare systems must continue to be strengthened, both to manage COVID-19 long-term and to 11\nabsorb increased cases of secondary diseases due to pandemic related disruptions of routine immunization.\nGender Update\nNew data from UN women reveals that 26 HRP countries had gender sensitive pandemic policies, with seven gender\nsensitive policies implemented on average. The refers to policies adopted at the national level that directly address 12\nchallenges which uniquely or disproportionately affect women and girls, including violence against women and girls (96\npolicies), women’s economic security (94 policies), or unpaid care work (3 policies). For instance, a policy addressing women’s\neconomic security may target women to receive household cash transfers or prioritize for benefits a subset of workers in\nwhich women are significantly overrepresented. Colombia implemented the most gender sensitive policies (31), followed by\nHonduras (17) and oPt (16). Iraq and Libya had none. Only three countries – Burundi, oPt, and Ukraine – implemented policies\ndirectly supporting unpaid care. Women took on a greater burden of unpaid caregiving, including caring for sick relatives\nduring the pandemic. Failing to support this labor disadvantages women and undermines their empowerment.\nFigure 11.

The pandemic eroded progress on gender-based violence,\neconomic empowerment, education, and healthcare. COVID-19 and its secondary effects lef women and girls in a worse\nposition than before the pandemic and increased vulnerability to compounding crises, such as food insecurity or conflict. The\npandemic set back progress on domestic violence, with the percent of respondents who believe there are acceptable\ncircumstances to hit a partner increasing by 2 percentage points to 19 percent, according to a 20-country survey. Women’s 13\neconomic security also remains at risk. Globally, women’s poverty continues to increase, with more women in poverty than\nmen. Over 11 million girls remain at risk of not returning to school, reducing their employment and earning opportunities 14\nand increasing the risk of early marriage and pregnancy. Many women and girls also lost access to reproductive care as 15\nhealthcare systems were strained by COVID-19, contributing to maternal mortality, unwanted pregnancies, disease, and\nschool dropouts. Global estimates suggest that the pandemic caused a 37 percent increase in maternal deaths. Across Latin 16\nAmerica and the Caribbean, 1 in 4 girls did not have access to family planning services. As data remains limited, the full 17\nrepercussions of the pandemic on women and girls may not be known for years to come.\n4.
